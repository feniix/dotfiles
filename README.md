- **Validation**: Repository structure validation and auto-fixing

## Quick Installation

### One-line Setup (Fresh Install)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feniix/dotfiles/master/setup.sh | bash
```

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Command Line Tools:**
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/feniix/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
   cd ~/dotfiles
   ```

3. **Run the Setup Script:**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

## XDG File Locations

After installation, configuration files will be located at:

- **Zsh**: `~/.config/zsh/.zshrc`
- **Neovim**: `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`
- **tmux**: `~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`
- **Git**: `~/.config/git/config`
- **Homebrew**: `~/.config/homebrew/Brewfile`

```

## Modular Installation

The main setup script provides options for partial installations:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles && ./setup.sh
```

Then select from the menu:
1. Update existing dotfiles to XDG format
2. Run XDG setup only (for migrating existing configs)
3. Run platform-specific setup only (macOS or Linux)
4. Run Neovim setup only
5. Run Homebrew setup only
6. Set up fonts
7. Set up GitHub integration
8. Clean up legacy files
9. Exit

## Individual Components

You can also run individual setup scripts directly:

```bash
# Install and configure GitHub integration
./scripts/setup/setup_github.sh

# Install programming fonts with Nerd Font patches
./scripts/setup/setup_fonts.sh

# Set up Homebrew and install packages
./scripts/setup/setup_homebrew.sh

# Set up platform-specific configuration
./scripts/setup/setup_macos.sh   # For macOS
./scripts/setup/setup_linux.sh   # For Linux
```

## Safety Features

The dotfiles setup includes several safety features:

- **Dependency Checking**: Verifies required tools are installed before proceeding
- **Repository Validation**: Checks for proper directory structure and files, auto-fixes issues
- **Automatic Backups**: Creates backups of existing configurations before modifying
- **Rollback Capability**: Restores from backup if an error occurs during installation
- **Consistent Logging**: Clear color-coded logging to understand what's happening

## Cross-Platform Support

This dotfiles repository works on:

- **macOS**: Full support for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
- **Linux**: Basic support for Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux

The setup script automatically detects your platform and runs the appropriate configuration.

## How It Works

- **Symlink Approach**: Configuration files remain in the dotfiles repository and are symlinked to their respective XDG locations
- **Zsh Theme**: Powerlevel10k theme is configured via zshrc
- **Plugin Management**: Plugins like zsh-completions are managed directly without git submodules
- **Modular Setup**: Each component (Neovim, Zsh, macOS settings) has its own setup script for easier maintenance

## Benefits of XDG Structure

- **Cleaner Home Directory**: No more dotfile clutter
- **Better Organization**: Configurations are grouped logically
- **Easier Backup**: All configurations in standardized locations
- **Portability**: Follows established standards

## Notes

- The `~/.zshenv` file is used to set up XDG environment variables
- Some legacy applications may still create dotfiles in the home directory
- Utility scripts are now linked to `~/bin` instead of `~/sbin` for better PATH compatibility
- Backups are stored in `~/.local/share/dotfiles_backup/TIMESTAMP/`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup, see [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed solutions.

### Quick Fixes

**Circular Symlinks**: If you see symlinks pointing to `@nvim` or `@zsh-completions`:
```bash
./scripts/utils/fix_circular_symlinks.sh
```

**Missing zsh plugins**: Install external oh-my-zsh plugins:
```bash
install_zsh_plugins
```

**Linux Homebrew path errors**: Restart your shell or run:
```bash
source ~/.zshenv
```

Common issues and solutions:
- **Permission errors**: Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x`)
- **Missing dependencies**: Install required tools for your platform
- **Path issues**: Verify `DOTFILES_DIR` environment variable is set correctly
