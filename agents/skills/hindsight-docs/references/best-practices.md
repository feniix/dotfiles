## Core Concepts

### Memory Banks

A **memory bank** is an isolated memory store — the unit of separation between users, agents, or contexts. All operations (retain, recall, reflect) target a single bank. Banks do not share data.

- One bank per user is the most common pattern for multi-user applications
- One bank per agent is common for agent-specific long-term memory
- A shared bank with tags can work for cross-user analysis (see [Tags](#tags-naming-conventions))

Banks are auto-created on first use. Configure them before ingesting data to steer behavior.

---

### Taxonomy

| Operation | What it does | When to call it |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Retain** | Ingests raw content (conversations, documents, notes). The LLM extracts facts, entities, and relationships — raw content is never stored verbatim. | After each conversation turn or session ends |
| **Recall** | Retrieves relevant memories using 4 parallel strategies: semantic search, BM25, graph traversal, and temporal ranking. Returns a ranked list of facts. | Before generating a response that benefits from past context |
| **Reflect** | Autonomous reasoning loop: searches memory, synthesizes an answer, and returns it directly. Uses mental models and observations hierarchically. | When you want Hindsight to answer a question, not just retrieve facts |
| **Observations** | Deduplicated, evidence-grounded knowledge consolidated from multiple facts. Each observation tracks its supporting memories with exact quotes and proof counts. Refined — not overwritten — when new evidence supports, contradicts, or extends them. | Triggered automatically after retain — not part of the retain call itself |
| **Mental Models** | Pre-computed reflect responses stored for common queries. Return instantly and consistently. | Create for repeated high-traffic queries or slowly-changing user profiles |

---

### Memory Types

Facts extracted during retain are classified into three types:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `world` | General knowledge, external facts | "The Eiffel Tower is in Paris" |
| `experience` | Personal events, user-specific facts | "User moved to Berlin in 2024" |
| `observation` | Consolidated belief grounded in multiple supporting facts; deduplicated and refined over time with tracked evidence | "User consistently prefers async communication (5 supporting memories)" |

Use `types` filtering in recall to target specific memory types.

---

## Bank Configuration

Configure a bank before first use to steer memory behavior for your domain. Misconfigured missions are the single biggest cause of low-quality memories.

### Writing Effective Missions

All three missions accept plain language. Be specific about your domain — vague missions produce vague results.

#### `retain_mission`

Injected into the fact extraction prompt. Tells the LLM what to extract and what to ignore.

| Quality | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Good** | `Always extract technical decisions, API design choices, architectural trade-offs, blockers, and error messages. Ignore greetings, small talk, and scheduling logistics.` |
| **Good** | `Extract personal preferences, ongoing commitments, deadlines, health info, and relationship details. Ignore filler phrases and pleasantries.` |
| **Bad** | `Extract all information` — too vague, extracts noise |
| **Bad** | `Be helpful` — not an extraction directive |

**Tips:**
- List the fact *types* you want (preferences, decisions, errors, commitments)
- List what to *ignore* — this is as important as what to include
- Match the mission to your actual data type (conversations vs documents vs tickets)

#### `observations_mission`

Steers what patterns are synthesized during consolidation. Runs after retain.

```
Identify evolving preferences, recurring patterns, behavioral shifts, and contradictions
with prior knowledge. Focus on durable patterns — not transient states. Highlight when
user behavior contradicts previous observations.
```

**Tips:**
- Emphasize "durable patterns" to avoid ephemeral observation noise
- Mention contradiction detection explicitly if you need historical tracking
- Match scope to how often you expect patterns to change

#### `reflect_mission`

Sets the agent persona and reasoning frame for `reflect` operations.

| Use Case | Mission |
|----------|---------|
| Coding assistant | `You are a senior developer helping optimize the user's workflow. Always factor in past technical decisions, current project context, and stated preferences. Be direct and opinionated.` |
| Customer support | `You are a support agent with full context of this customer's history. Reference past tickets and resolutions where relevant. Be concise and solution-focused.` |
| Personal assistant | `You are a personal assistant who remembers everything important to the user. Personalize every response using what you know about their preferences, schedule, and ongoing projects.` |
| Medical assistant | `You are a health assistant. Reference the user's history accurately. Always recommend consulting a professional for medical decisions. Do not speculate.` |

---

### Disposition Traits

Dispositions affect `reflect` only (not `recall`). Scale 1–5.

| Trait | 1 | 5 |
|-------|---|---|
| `skepticism` | Trusts all memories at face value | Questions contradictions, flags uncertain info |
| `literalism` | Liberal interpretation, infers intent | Strict literal reading, no inference |
| `empathy` | Clinical, neutral tone | Warm, personal, emotionally aware |

**Common profiles:**

| Agent type | Skepticism | Literalism | Empathy |
|------------|------------|------------|---------|
| Code review | 4 | 5 | 1 |
| Customer support | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| Personal assistant | 2 | 2 | 4 |
| Medical assistant | 5 | 4 | 3 |
| Research assistant | 4 | 4 | 2 |

---

### Entity Labels

Define a controlled vocabulary for classification. The LLM will extract and normalize values to your defined set.

```json
{
  "entity_labels": [
    {
      "key": "tech_stack",
      "type": "multi-values",
      "values": [
        {"value": "python", "description": "Python programming language"},
        {"value": "typescript", "description": "TypeScript / Node.js"},
        {"value": "react", "description": "React frontend framework"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "key": "priority",
      "type": "value",
      "tag": true,
      "values": [
        {"value": "high", "description": "Urgent or blocking"},
        {"value": "low", "description": "Nice to have"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`type: "value"`** — single value per entity (last write wins)
- **`type: "multi-values"`** — accumulates multiple values
- **`tag: true`** — extracted label values are also added as tags (enables filtering by entity value)

Use entity labels when you need consistent classification — domain-specific terms, status values, priority levels, engagement types.

## Retaining Data

### Content Format

Pass the richest representation available. Never pre-summarize.

| Format | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| JSON conversation array | **Preferred** for conversations — preserves structure, roles, and relationships |
| Prefixed plain text | Acceptable — `[ISO-timestamp] role: text` per line |
| Markdown / HTML / raw text | Works for documents and notes |
| Pre-summarized text | **Avoid** — loses entity relationships, temporal markers, structural context |

**Conversation JSON (preferred):**

```json
[
  {"role": "user",      "content": "I'm using React for the frontend.", "timestamp": "2025-06-01T10:30:00Z"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it. What state management are you using?"},
  {"role": "user",      "content": "Zustand. We moved away from Redux last quarter."}
]
```

**Why not pre-summarize:** The LLM extracts facts, entities, and relationships from structure. A summary like "user uses React and Zustand" loses the temporal reference ("last quarter"), the entity relationship (React↔frontend, Redux↔migration), and the causal context (moved away from).

---

### The `context` Field

High-impact on extraction quality. Always set it. Describes the *nature and source* of the content.

```python
# Good — specific, descriptive
context="Customer support ticket #12345 from user Alice about a billing discrepancy"
context="Developer's architecture review session for the payments service"
context="User's onboarding form: stated goals, current tools, and team size"
context="Weekly standup notes: blockers, progress, and upcoming tasks"

# Bad — generic, adds no signal
context="some data"
context="conversation"
# Omitted entirely — extraction uses no context
```

---

### The `document_id` Field

Use for upsert behavior. Same `document_id` = delete previous version and reprocess.

**Rules:**
- Use stable, meaningful IDs (session ID, ticket ID, document UUID)
- Always use the same ID for a growing conversation — retain the full conversation with each new message
- Do NOT use random UUIDs per retain call — this creates duplicates

```python
# Good — stable session ID
client.retain(bank_id="user-alice", items=[{
    "content": full_conversation,
    "document_id": f"session-{session_id}",
}])

# Bad — new random ID every call = duplicates
client.retain(bank_id="user-alice", items=[{
    "content": full_conversation,
    "document_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),  # ❌ creates a new document each time
}])
```

---

### The `timestamp` Field

Set whenever you have temporal context. Enables temporal retrieval strategies.

- ISO 8601 format: `"2025-06-01T10:32:00Z"`
- For conversations: set to when the conversation *started*
- Omitting it disables temporal ranking entirely

---

### Tags: Naming Conventions

Tags scope visibility. A memory tagged `user:alice` is only returned for recall/reflect calls that include `user:alice` in their `tags` filter (with strict matching).

**Standard naming conventions:**

| Pattern | Example | Use for |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `user:<id>` | `user:alice`, `user:u_123` | Per-user isolation |
| `session:<id>` | `session:s_abc` | Session-scoped memories |
| `team:<name>` | `team:engineering` | Shared team knowledge |
| `topic:<name>` | `topic:billing`, `topic:technical` | Domain filtering |
| `scope:<name>` | `scope:private`, `scope:public` | Visibility tiers |

**Multi-tenant minimum:** Every retain for user data must include at least `user:<id>`. Omitting it makes the memory globally visible.

```python
# Multi-tenant retain — always tag with user ID
items=[{
    "content": conversation,
    "tags": ["user:alice", "session:s_abc", "topic:billing"],
    "document_id": f"session-{session_id}",
}]
```

---

### Metadata Schema

Use for source tracking and downstream linking. **Not filterable** — use tags for filtering.

```python
# Source tracking
metadata={"source": "slack", "channel": "#engineering", "thread_id": "T123456"}

# Ticket linking
metadata={"ticket_id": "JIRA-123", "priority": "high", "reporter": "alice"}

# Document provenance
metadata={"url": "https://...", "section": "pricing-faq", "version": "2025-Q1"}
```

Metadata is returned with every recalled memory — use it to link memories back to source systems for UI display, deep-linking, or audit trails.

---

### Observation Scopes

Controls which tag combinations get their own observation pass.

| Value | Behavior | When to use |
|-------|----------|------------|
| `"combined"` | One pass with all tags together | Default — single-user banks, general use |
| `"per_tag"` | One pass per tag independently | Users should have isolated behavioral observations |
| `"all_combinations"` | All possible subsets of tags | Complex multi-dimensional analysis (expensive) |
| Custom list | Explicit scope list | Precise multi-tenant control |

**Custom scope example (recommended for multi-tenant):**

```python
# Observations scoped to: user-level, team-level, and combined
observation_scopes=[
    ["user:alice"],
    ["team:engineering"],
    ["user:alice", "team:engineering"],
]
```

---

### Sync vs Async

| Mode | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `async_=False` (default) | When you need confirmation before proceeding |
| `async_=True` | End-of-turn or end-of-session retain; user-facing flows where latency matters |

Do not retain and recall in the same turn — retain is a write operation and the extracted memories will not be available immediately.

---

## Recalling Memories

### Budget Selection

| Budget | Latency | Use when |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `low` | 50–100ms | Simple fact lookups, single-hop questions |
| `mid` | 100–300ms | Multi-hop reasoning, relationship queries *(default)* |
| `high` | 300–500ms | Deep exploration, complex cross-domain patterns |

Default to `mid`. Use `low` for high-frequency agent loops. Reserve `high` for explicit "deep recall" user-triggered flows.

---

### Tag Filtering Modes

| Mode | Includes untagged? | Condition |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| `any` *(default)* | Yes | At least one tag matches, OR untagged |
| `all` | Yes | All specified tags present, OR untagged |
| `any_strict` | No | At least one tag matches |
| `all_strict` | No | All specified tags present |

**Decision guide:**
- Shared global knowledge + per-user: `tags=["user:alice"], tags_match="any"` — returns Alice's memories and untagged global memories
- Fully partitioned (no leakage): `tags=["user:alice"], tags_match="any_strict"` — Alice's memories only
- Multi-condition AND: `tags=["user:alice", "topic:billing"], tags_match="all_strict"` — only where both tags present

**`tag_groups` for complex filters:**

Tag groups use a tree structure with `and`/`or`/`not` compound nodes and `{"tags": [...], "match": "..."}` leaf nodes.

```python
# Alice's billing memories OR shared billing memories (no user tag)
recall(
    query="...",
    tag_groups=[
        {"or": [
            {"tags": ["user:alice", "topic:billing"], "match": "all_strict"},
            {"and": [
                {"tags": ["topic:billing"], "match": "any_strict"},
                {"not": {"tags": ["user:alice"], "match": "any_strict"}},
            ]},
        ]}
    ]
)
```

---

### `include` Options

| Option | Default | Enable when |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `include.entities` | Enabled | — (leave on; provides entity context for graph traversal) |
| `include.chunks` | Disabled | Agent needs exact wording or source quotation |
| `include.source_facts` | Disabled | Tracing observation provenance for auditing |

---

### `types` Filtering

| Value | Returns |
|-------|---------|
| *(not set)* | All types |
| `["observation"]` | Consolidated patterns only — faster for high-level questions |
| `["world", "experience"]` | Raw facts only — for ground-truth or citation-sensitive queries |

---

### Filtering by Memory Shape with Entity Labels

When a single bank contains semantically similar memories that serve different purposes (e.g., concise operating rules vs. detailed troubleshooting procedures), ranking alone cannot reliably distinguish them — two memories about "entrypoints" will score similarly regardless of whether one is a one-line rule and the other is a multi-step runbook.

Use [entity labels](developer/api/memory-banks.md#entity-labels) with `tag: true` to classify facts at retain time and hard-filter at recall time.

**1. Define a label group on the bank:**

```json
{
  "entity_labels": [
    {
      "key": "memory_type",
      "description": "The type of knowledge: 'rule' for concise operating rules and canonical guidance, 'procedure' for step-by-step technical instructions and troubleshooting notes",
      "type": "value",
      "optional": false,
      "tag": true,
      "values": [
        { "value": "rule",      "description": "Concise operating rule or canonical guidance" },
        { "value": "procedure", "description": "Step-by-step technical instruction or troubleshooting note" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Retain normally** — the LLM classifies each fact automatically and writes `memory_type:rule` or `memory_type:procedure` as a tag.

**3. Filter at recall time:**

```python
# Only rules — procedures are excluded at the database level, not post-filtered
result = client.recall(
    bank_id="my-bank",
    query="which entrypoint should I use?",
    tags=["memory_type:rule"],
    tags_match="any_strict"
)
```

This is a hard SQL WHERE clause applied across all four retrieval strategies. The unwanted memories never enter the ranking pipeline.

---

### `query_timestamp`

Set for time-sensitive queries. Anchors relative temporal expressions and recency scoring to a specific point in time.

```python
# "What was the team working on in January?"
recall(query="team priorities", query_timestamp="2025-01-31T23:59:59Z")

# Current context (most common)
recall(query="user preferences", query_timestamp=datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z")
```

---

## Reflecting

### Recall vs Reflect

| Use `recall` when | Use `reflect` when |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Agent will reason over facts itself | You want Hindsight to reason and return an answer |
| You need raw citations | You need a synthesized response |
| You're building a RAG pipeline | You want an autonomous multi-step search loop |
| Latency is critical | Response quality matters more than latency |
| You need precise fact counts | You need a contextual, nuanced answer |

---

### `response_schema`

Use when you need structured output for programmatic consumption.

```python
reflect(
    query="What are the user's top 3 technical preferences?",
    response_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "preferences": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {"type": "string"},
                "maxItems": 3
            },
            "confidence": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 1}
        },
        "required": ["preferences", "confidence"]
    }
)
# Returns: result.structured_output["preferences"], result.structured_output["confidence"]
```

---

### Auditing and Debugging

| Option | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `include.facts=True` | Exposes which memories and mental models were used (for transparency/auditing) |
| `include.tool_calls=True` | Full execution trace of the internal search loop (for debugging) |

Enable `include.facts` in production for audit trails. Enable `include.tool_calls` only during development.

---

## Mental Models

Mental models are pre-computed `reflect` responses stored for common queries. They return instantly and consistently.

### When to Create

- Common repeated queries that should return consistent answers
- High-traffic agents that need sub-100ms responses
- User profiles or personas read on every request
- Knowledge summaries reviewed or approved by humans
- Cross-session state that changes slowly (preferences, skills, background)

### Tag Strategy

Tags on a mental model filter BOTH which memories are used to build it AND which recall/reflect calls can see it.

```python
# Per-user mental model — uses Alice's memories (all_strict applied automatically during refresh)
create_mental_model(
    bank_id="shared-bank",
    name="Alice's Technical Profile",
    source_query="Summarize Alice's technical background, preferred stack, and current projects",
    tags=["user:alice"],
)

# Global mental model — uses all memories, visible to everyone
create_mental_model(
    bank_id="shared-bank",
    name="Team Engineering Standards",
    source_query="What are the team's agreed engineering standards and conventions?",
    # No tags — reads all memories, visible to all
)
```

### Refresh Strategy

| Trigger | When to use |
|---------|------------|
| Manual via API | After significant data updates or review cycles |
| `trigger={"refresh_after_consolidation": True}` | When observations update frequently and the model should stay current |

Create narrow, scoped models — one per knowledge dimension. A mental model titled "Everything about the user" is as useful as none.

**Model granularity examples for a personal assistant:**
- "User Profile" — demographics, preferences, stated goals
- "Current Projects" — active work, deadlines, blockers
- "Technical Stack" — languages, tools, frameworks used
- "Communication Style" — formality preferences, response length preferences

---

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Problem | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Pre-summarizing before retain | Loses entity relationships, temporal markers, structural context | Retain raw content; Hindsight extracts facts |
| Using random UUIDs as `document_id` | Creates duplicate documents on every retain | Use stable session/ticket/document IDs |
| Omitting the `context` field | Reduces extraction quality significantly | Always describe what kind of data this is |
| Using `metadata` for filtering | Metadata is not filterable | Use `tags` for anything you'll filter on |
| Vague or generic missions | Generic extraction = noisy, low-value memories | Be specific about domain, data type, what to ignore |
| `tags_match="any"` for multi-tenant banks | Leaks memories across users | Use `any_strict` or `all_strict` for user-partitioned data |
| Retaining and recalling in the same request | Retained memories not yet indexed | Retain end-of-turn; recall at the start of next turn |
| One mental model for everything | Low accuracy, slow refresh, hard to scope | Create one model per knowledge dimension |
| `high` budget for every recall | Expensive, slow, usually unnecessary | Use `low` for simple lookups, `mid` default |
| Missing `timestamp` on retain | Disables temporal retrieval strategies | Always set from actual content timestamps |
