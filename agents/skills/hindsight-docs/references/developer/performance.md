# Performance

Hindsight is designed for high-performance semantic memory operations at scale. This page covers performance characteristics, optimization strategies, and best practices.

## Overview

Hindsight's performance is optimized across three key operations:

- **Retain (Ingestion)**: Batch processing with async operations for large-scale memory storage
- **Recall (Search)**: Sub-second semantic search with configurable thinking budgets
- **Reflect (Reasoning)**: Disposition-aware answer generation with controllable compute

## Design Philosophy: Optimized for Fast Reads

Hindsight is **architected from the ground up to prioritize read performance over write performance**. This design decision reflects the typical usage pattern of memory systems: memories are written once but read many times.

The system makes deliberate trade-offs to ensure **sub-second recall operations**:

- **Pre-computed embeddings**: All memory embeddings are generated and indexed during retention
- **Optimized vector search**: HNSW indexes enable fast approximate nearest neighbor search
- **Fact extraction at write time**: Complex LLM-based fact extraction happens during retention, not retrieval
- **Structured memory graphs**: Relationships and temporal information are resolved upfront

This means **Recall (search) operations are blazingly fast** because all the heavy lifting has already been done.

### Performance Comparison

| Operation | Typical Latency | Primary Bottleneck | Optimization Strategy            |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Recall** | 100-600ms | Re-ranker (on CPU) | Use GPU for re-ranking, or reduce budget |
| **Reflect** | 800-3000ms | LLM generation | Use faster LLM                   |
| **Retain** | 500ms-2000ms per batch | **LLM fact extraction** | Use high-throughput LLM provider |

Hindsight is designed to ensure your **application's read path (recall/reflect) is always fast**, even if it means spending more time upfront during writes. This is the right trade-off for memory systems where:

- Memories are retained in background processes or during low-traffic periods
- Memories are queried frequently in user-facing, latency-sensitive contexts
- The ratio of reads to writes is high (typically 10:1 or higher)

## Retain Performance

**Retain (write) operations are inherently slower** because they involve LLM-based fact extraction, entity recognition, temporal reasoning, relationship mapping, and embedding generation. **The LLM is the primary bottleneck for write latency.**

### Hindsight Doesn't Need a Smart Model

The fact extraction process is structured and well-defined, so smaller, faster models work extremely well. Our recommended model is `gpt-oss-20b` (available via Groq and other providers).

To maximize retention throughput:

1. **Use high-throughput LLM providers**: Choose providers with high requests-per-minute (RPM) limits and low latency
   - **Fast**: [Groq](https://groq.com) with `gpt-oss-20b` or other openai-oss models, self-hosted models on GPU clusters (vLLM, TGI)
   - **Slow**: Standard cloud LLM providers with rate limits

2. **Batch your operations**: Group related content into batch requests. Send as much data as you want in a single request — the only limit is the HTTP payload size.

3. **Use async mode for large datasets**: Queue operations in the background

4. **Parallel processing**: For very large datasets, use multiple concurrent retention requests with different `document_id` values

### Automatic Batch Optimization

**When using async retain, Hindsight automatically handles batch sizing for you.** You don't need to manually tune batch sizes or worry about optimal chunking.

How it works:
- **Send large batches**: Submit hundreds or thousands of items in a single async retain request
- **Automatic splitting**: Hindsight automatically splits large batches (>10,000 tokens) into optimized sub-batches
- **Parallel processing**: Sub-batches are processed concurrently in the background
- **Status tracking**: Parent operation aggregates status from all sub-batches
- **Token-based**: Batching counts real tokens, not characters

Benefits:
- Send entire documents or datasets in one API call
- Let Hindsight optimize the processing strategy
- Track overall progress via the parent operation status
- No need to manually split data into small batches

### Throughput

Factors affecting throughput:
- Document size and complexity
- LLM provider rate limits (for fact extraction)
- Database write performance
- Available CPU/memory resources

## Tuning for Local & Small Environments

Hindsight's defaults are tuned for cloud LLM providers and multi-core servers. When you run it on a laptop, a single GPU box, or against a **local LLM server** (llama.cpp, vLLM, LM Studio, Ollama) with a small fixed slot pool, those defaults can saturate the backend, time out, or thrash the CPU. This section collects the knobs that matter for low-resource setups.

### LLM concurrency

The default `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT=32` assumes a cloud provider that can absorb dozens of parallel requests. A local server with a handful of slots cannot — Hindsight will fill every slot and **starve any other client sharing the endpoint** (your main agent, another app, or a second Hindsight operation).

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT=2
```

A value of `2` lets retain and consolidation run concurrently without blocking each other. If the endpoint is **shared** with other clients (other applications, agents, or workflows hitting the same llama-server / vLLM / LM Studio instance), reserve slots for them by lowering further — leave at least one slot free per shared client.

You can also split the budget per operation so background work never crowds out live reads. The per-operation caps compose *on top of* the global cap:

```bash
# global=4, with retain/consolidation capped low so reflect always has headroom
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT=4
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT=1
export HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT=1
```

### Timeouts and retries

Small models on modest hardware generate tokens slowly, and the first request after startup pays a model-load cost. The default `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TIMEOUT=120` (seconds) can be too tight for a large local model on CPU — raise it to avoid spurious timeouts and wasted retries:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TIMEOUT=300        # allow slow local generation
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_RETRIES=2      # fail faster locally — retries rarely help a slow box
```

A local endpoint isn't rate-limited, so aggressive retry/backoff mostly adds latency on real failures. Lower retries and let genuine errors surface quickly.

### Smaller, faster models — and reasoning effort

Retain (fact extraction) is structured work that does not need a frontier model; reflect can use a lighter model still. On a constrained box, point each operation at the smallest model that holds up:

```bash
# Reflect on a small/fast model; retain on a slightly stronger structured-output model
export HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_MODEL=<small-fast-model>
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MODEL=<structured-output-model>
```

If your model exposes a reasoning/thinking budget, set it low — extra reasoning tokens are pure latency for the extraction and consolidation paths. Nothing is sent unless you set it, so an unconfigured deployment runs at whatever effort the model defaults to (`none` is the value that switches thinking off entirely, where the backend supports it):

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_REASONING_EFFORT=low
```

Consolidation sends multiple facts to the LLM in a single call (default 8). On a small model with a limited context window, a large batch produces an oversized prompt and a long, error-prone response. Shrink the batch so each consolidation call stays small and reliable:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_BATCH_SIZE=2   # default 8; lower = smaller prompts, more calls
```

### Built-in llama.cpp tuning

The bundled `llamacpp` provider runs a llama.cpp server as a managed subprocess — no external server needed. Key knobs for small machines:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=llamacpp
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT=2        # retain + consolidation without blocking
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_GPU_LAYERS=-1      # -1 = offload all layers to GPU; 0 = CPU only
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_CONTEXT_SIZE=8192  # lower to save RAM/VRAM; raise for big batches
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_EXTRA_ARGS="--n_threads 8"  # match physical cores on CPU-only boxes
# export HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_NO_GRAMMAR=true  # faster, but less reliable JSON output
```

See [Built-in llama.cpp](./configuration#built-in-llamacpp) for the full option list.

### Reranker on CPU

Recall's bottleneck on a machine without a GPU is the cross-encoder reranker. The local reranker has several CPU/Apple-Silicon knobs that are quality-neutral but materially faster:

```bash
# Apple Silicon (MPS): half precision is 27–36% faster, quality-identical
export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_LOCAL_FP16=true

# Sort pairs by length before batching — 36–54% faster, quality-identical by construction
export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_LOCAL_BUCKET_BATCHING=true

# Cap reranker parallelism so it doesn't thrash a small CPU under load (default 4)
export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_LOCAL_MAX_CONCURRENT=2

# On macOS, force CPU if MPS/XPC causes instability
# export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_LOCAL_FORCE_CPU=true
```

The biggest single win on CPU is reranking fewer candidates. By default Hindsight reranks up to 300 candidates per recall — shrink that pool to cut cross-encoder work proportionally:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES=100   # default 300; RRF pre-filters the rest
```

For a pure-CPU box that struggles with the cross-encoder, `flashrank` is a lighter ONNX-based reranker:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_PROVIDER=flashrank
```

You can also reduce recall work directly: use a lower `budget` (`low`/`mid`) for everyday queries and reserve `high` for comprehensive reasoning. See [Recall Performance](#recall-performance) below.

## Recall Performance

### Budget

The `budget` parameter controls the search depth and quality. Choose based on query complexity — comprehensive questions that need thorough analysis benefit from higher budgets:

| Budget | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `low` | Quick lookups, real-time chat |
| `mid` | Standard queries, balanced performance |
| `high` | Comprehensive questions, thorough analysis |

### Optimization

1. **Appropriate budgets**: Use lower budgets for simple queries, higher for comprehensive reasoning
2. **Limit result tokens**: Set `max_tokens` to control response size (default: 4096)
3. **Include chunks**: Use `include_chunks` to retrieve the raw text that generated memories when you need additional context

### Database Performance

Hindsight uses PostgreSQL with pgvector for efficient vector search:

- **Index type**: HNSW for approximate nearest neighbor search
- **Typical query time**: 10-50ms for vector search on 100K+ facts
- **Scalability**: Tested with millions of facts per bank

## Reflect Performance

### Performance Characteristics

| Component | Latency        | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Memory search | 100-600ms      | Based on budget (low/mid/high) |
| LLM generation | 500-2000ms     | Depends on provider and response length |
| **Total** | **600-2600ms** | Typical end-to-end latency |

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Budget selection**: Use lower budgets when context is sufficient
2. **Context provision**: Provide relevant `context` to reduce recall requirements and steer towards more focused answers

## Best Practices

### Operations
- **Use appropriate budgets**: Don't over-provision for simple queries; use higher budgets for comprehensive reasoning
- **Batch retain operations**: Group related content together for better efficiency
- **Cache frequent queries**: Cache at the application level for repeated queries
- **Profile with trace**: Use the `trace` parameter to identify slow operations

### Scaling
- **Horizontal scaling**: Deploy multiple API instances behind a load balancer with shared PostgreSQL
- **Concurrency**: 100+ simultaneous requests supported; memory search scales with CPU cores
- **LLM rate limits**: Distribute load across multiple API keys/providers (typically 60-500 RPM per key)

### Cost Optimization
- **Use efficient models**: `gpt-oss-20b` via Groq for retain — Hindsight doesn't need frontier models
- **Enable provider Batch API**: Set `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_ENABLED=true` with async retain to cut LLM fact-extraction costs by 50% (supported on OpenAI and Groq; results delivered within 24 hours)
- **Control token budgets**: Limit `max_tokens` for recall, use lower budgets when possible
- **Optimize chunks**: Larger chunks (1000-2000 tokens) are more efficient than many small ones

### Monitoring
- **Prometheus metrics**: Available at `/metrics` — track latency percentiles, throughput, and error rates
- **Key metrics**: `hindsight_recall_duration_seconds`, `hindsight_reflect_duration_seconds`, `hindsight_retain_items_total`
