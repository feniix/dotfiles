# Reflect: Agentic Reasoning with Disposition

When you call `reflect()`, Hindsight runs an **agentic loop** that autonomously gathers evidence and reasons through the lens of the bank's disposition to generate contextual responses.

**Figure: Reflect Agent Loop.** An animated diagram on the docs site; its narration, step by step:

- **reflect()**
  1. reflect() gets a question that needs reasoning, not just lookup.
  2. The bank’s mission, disposition and directives go into the agent’s instructions before it looks anything up.
  3. Each turn is one tool call. Retrieval starts at the top, with mental models: curated summaries kept up to date.
  4. A fresh mental model can be enough to answer. This one covers the team, not the ML project, so the agent keeps looking.
  5. Then observations: beliefs consolidated from many facts.
  6. The result is flagged stale: the bank has facts not yet consolidated into observations. So the agent must check the raw facts.
  7. recall() runs the full four-way search over raw facts: the ground truth.
  8. The newer fact is what the stale observation was missing: Alice asked to move to ML herself.
  9. recall already returns the chunk each fact came from. expand goes further: the whole source document, for the full context.
  10. The agent calls done. Every cited ID is checked against what it actually retrieved; anything else is dropped. It must gather evidence first, and stops after 10 iterations at most.
  11. The answer follows the directives and the bank’s disposition, and comes back with the memories it is based on.

## How It Works

Unlike simple retrieval, reflect is an **agentic system** that:

1. **Autonomously gathers evidence** — The agent decides what information it needs and calls appropriate tools
2. **Uses hierarchical retrieval** — Checks mental models first, then observations, then raw facts
3. **Applies disposition** — Shapes reasoning based on the bank's personality traits
4. **Enforces applicable directives** — Global rules and rules matching the reflect tag scope
5. **Cites sources** — Returns which memories and observations were used

### The Agentic Loop

The reflect agent runs in a loop with access to these tools:

| Tool | Purpose | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| `search_mental_models` | User-curated summaries | Highest (check first) |
| `search_observations` | Consolidated knowledge | High |
| `recall` | Raw facts (ground truth) | Fallback |
| `expand` | Get more context for a memory | As needed |
| `done` | Complete with final answer | When ready |

The agent:
- **Must gather evidence** before answering (guardrail prevents empty responses)
- **Runs up to 10 iterations** to find relevant information
- **Validates citations** — only IDs that were actually retrieved can be cited

### Hierarchical Retrieval Strategy

The agent uses a smart retrieval hierarchy:

1. **[Mental Models](api/mental-models.md)** — User-curated summaries you've pre-computed for common queries
2. **[Observations](observations.md)** — Consolidated knowledge with freshness awareness
3. **Raw Facts** — Ground truth for verification when observations are stale

**Mental models** are saved reflect responses that you create for frequently asked questions. They're checked first because they represent explicitly curated knowledge. See the [Mental Models API](api/mental-models.md) for how to create and manage them.

If an observation is marked as **stale**, the agent automatically verifies it against current facts.

## Why Reflect?

Most AI systems can retrieve facts, but they can't **reason** about them in a consistent way.

### The Problem

Without reflect:
- **No consistent character**: Same question gets different answers each time
- **No knowledge synthesis**: System never connects related facts
- **No reasoning context**: Responses don't reflect accumulated knowledge
- **Generic responses**: Every AI sounds the same

### The Value

With reflect:
- **Consistent character**: A "detail-oriented, cautious" bank emphasizes risks and thorough planning
- **Evolving knowledge**: Observations strengthen and adapt as evidence accumulates
- **Contextual reasoning**: "Based on what I know about your team's remote work success..."
- **Differentiated behavior**: Support bots sound diplomatic, code reviewers sound direct

### When to Use Reflect

| Use `recall()` when... | Use `reflect()` when... |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| You need raw facts | You need reasoned interpretation |
| You're building your own reasoning | You want disposition-consistent responses |
| You need maximum control | You want the bank to "think" for itself |
| Simple fact lookup | Forming recommendations |

**Example:**
- `recall("Alice")` → Returns all Alice facts and relevant mental models
- `reflect("Should we hire Alice?")` → Agent gathers evidence about Alice, reasons about fit, returns answer with citations

## Disposition Traits

When you create a memory bank, you can configure its disposition using three traits. These traits influence how the bank interprets information and reasons during `reflect()`:

| Trait | Scale | Low (1) | High (5) |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Skepticism** | 1-5 | Trusting, accepts information at face value | Skeptical, questions and doubts claims |
| **Literalism** | 1-5 | Flexible interpretation, reads between the lines | Literal interpretation, takes things at face value |
| **Empathy** | 1-5 | Detached, focuses on facts | Empathetic, considers emotional context |

### Mission: Natural Language Identity

Beyond numeric traits, you can provide a natural language **mission** that describes the bank's identity and reasoning context:

```python
client.create_bank(bank_id="architect-bank")
client.update_bank_config(
    "architect-bank",
    reflect_mission="You're a senior software architect - keep track of system designs, "
            "technology decisions, and architectural patterns. Prefer simplicity over cutting-edge.",
    disposition_skepticism=4,   # Questions new technologies
    disposition_literalism=4,   # Focuses on concrete specs
    disposition_empathy=2,      # Prioritizes technical facts
)
```

The reflect mission frames how the agent reasons and responds:
- Provides identity context: who the agent is and what it cares about
- Shapes how disposition traits are applied in practice
- Keeps reasoning consistent across conversations

> **ℹ️ Per-operation missions**
>
The reflect mission only affects `reflect()`. To steer what gets extracted during `retain()`, use [`retain_mission`](api/memory-banks.md#retain-configuration). To control what gets synthesised into observations, use [`observations_mission`](api/memory-banks.md#observations-configuration).

## Disposition Shapes Reasoning

Two banks with different dispositions, given identical facts about remote work:

**Bank A** (low skepticism, high empathy):
> "Remote work enables flexibility and work-life balance. The team seems happier and more productive when they can choose their environment."

**Bank B** (high skepticism, low empathy):
> "Remote work claims need verification. What are the actual productivity metrics? The anecdotal benefits may not translate to measurable outcomes."

**Same facts → Different conclusions** because disposition shapes interpretation.

---

## Disposition Presets by Use Case

Different use cases benefit from different disposition configurations:

| Use Case | Recommended Traits | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| **Customer Support** | skepticism: 2, literalism: 2, empathy: 5 | Trusting, flexible, understanding |
| **Code Review** | skepticism: 4, literalism: 5, empathy: 2 | Questions assumptions, precise, direct |
| **Legal Analysis** | skepticism: 5, literalism: 5, empathy: 2 | Highly skeptical, exact interpretation |
| **Therapist/Coach** | skepticism: 2, literalism: 2, empathy: 5 | Supportive, reads between lines |
| **Research Assistant** | skepticism: 4, literalism: 3, empathy: 3 | Questions claims, balanced interpretation |

## Directives: Hard Rules

While disposition traits *influence* reasoning style, **directives** are hard
rules that the agent *must* follow when they apply to the current reflect scope.
Untagged directives are global; tagged directives require matching reflect
tags. See [Memory Banks: Directives](api/memory-banks.md#directives) for
the full matching and default-behavior tables.

### When to Use Directives

Use directives for constraints that must never be violated:

- **Compliance rules**: "Never recommend specific stocks or financial products"
- **Privacy constraints**: "Never share personal data with third parties"
- **Style requirements**: "Always respond in formal English"
- **Domain guardrails**: "Always cite sources when making factual claims"

### Directive Scope and Tags

Directive `tags` scope when a directive applies, just like they scope memories. Untagged directives always apply; tagged directives apply only when the `reflect` request carries matching tags. A `reflect` with no tags therefore applies only the untagged directives. Set `apply_all_directives: true` on the request to enforce **every** active directive regardless of tags. See [Memory Banks: Directive Scope and Tags](api/memory-banks.md#directive-scope-and-tags).

### Directives vs Disposition

| Aspect | Disposition | Directives |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Nature** | Soft influence | Hard rules |
| **Effect** | Shapes interpretation and tone | Must be followed exactly |
| **Violation** | Acceptable (it's a tendency) | Not acceptable |
| **Example** | High skepticism → questions claims | "Never make medical diagnoses" |

> **💡 Tip**
>
Use disposition for personality and character. Use directives for compliance and guardrails.
See [Memory Banks: Directives](api/memory-banks.md#directives) for how to create and manage directives.

## What You Get from Reflect

When you call `reflect()`:

**Returns:**
- **Response text** — Disposition-influenced answer from the agent
- **based_on** — Evidence used: memories, mental models, and directives that grounded the response
- **trace** — Tool calls, LLM calls, and observations accessed (when `include.tool_calls=True`)
- **structured_output** — Parsed response if `response_schema` was provided
- **usage** — Token usage metrics

**Example:**
```json
{
  "text": "Based on Alice's ML expertise and her work at Google, she'd be an excellent fit for the research team lead position...",
  "based_on": {
    "memories": [
      {"id": "mem-123", "text": "Alice has 5 years of ML experience", "type": "world"},
      {"id": "mem-456", "text": "Alice worked at Google on search ranking", "type": "experience"}
    ],
    "mental_models": [],
    "directives": [
      {"id": "dir-001", "name": "Formal Language", "rules": ["Always respond in formal English"]}
    ]
  },
  "usage": {"input_tokens": 1500, "output_tokens": 500, "total_tokens": 2000}
}
```

The agent automatically gathers evidence, validates citations, and generates a grounded response.

---

## Structured Output

Reflect returns prose by default. Pass a `response_schema` (a JSON Schema **object** with a
`properties` map) to *also* get a machine-readable version of the same answer:

```json
{
  "query": "How does Alice fit the research lead role?",
  "response_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "recommendation": { "type": "string" },
      "strengths": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
      "confidence": { "type": "number" }
    },
    "required": ["recommendation"]
  }
}
```

The response then carries **both** the prose and the structured view:

```json
{
  "text": "Based on Alice's ML expertise and her work at Google, she'd be an excellent fit...",
  "structured_output": {
    "recommendation": "Strong fit for research lead",
    "strengths": ["5 years of ML experience", "Search ranking at Google"],
    "confidence": 0.9
  }
}
```

**How it works.** The agent first reasons to a natural-language answer, then a second pass
extracts that answer into JSON matching your schema. `structured_output` is therefore always a
faithful projection of `text` — you get the readable answer **and** a typed object to program
against, never one instead of the other.

**When extraction fails.** The reflect still returns `200` with the prose answer, no
`structured_output`, and a `structured_output_error` field saying why (a provider error, a timeout,
unparseable output). A missing `structured_output` *without* that field means the answer simply held
nothing matching your schema — so you can retry the broken case without retrying the ordinary one.

**Schema rules.** The schema must be an object with at least one property. Each property's `type`
is one of `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `array`, or `object`, and `required` lists
property names. Invalid schemas are rejected before the call runs, so a malformed schema fails
fast instead of silently returning nothing.

### Structured output for mental models

A pinned mental model can carry its own `response_schema` in its trigger config. Every refresh
then stores a `structured_output` next to the markdown content — extracted from the **final
stored document**. This matters for delta-mode (surgical) refreshes: the structured view reflects
the whole merged document, not just the facts that changed in that refresh.

### Building a schema (no code)

In the control plane, the reflect view and the mental-model dialogs include a **Build schema**
editor with a **Visual** mode (add fields — name, type, required, description) and a **Code** mode
(raw JSON). The page itself shows only whether a schema is set; all editing happens in the
builder, so you never hand-write JSON unless you want to.

## Why Disposition Matters

Without disposition, all AI assistants sound the same. With disposition:

- **Customer support bots** can be diplomatic and empathetic
- **Code review assistants** can be direct and thorough
- **Creative assistants** can be open to unconventional ideas
- **Risk analysts** can be appropriately cautious

Disposition creates **consistent character** across conversations while observations **evolve with evidence**.
