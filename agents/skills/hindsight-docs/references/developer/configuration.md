# Configuration

Complete reference for configuring Hindsight services through environment variables.

Hindsight has two services, each with its own configuration prefix:

| Service | Prefix | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **API Service** | `HINDSIGHT_API_*` | Core memory engine |
| **Control Plane** | `HINDSIGHT_CP_*` | Web UI |

---

## API Service

The API service handles all memory operations (retain, recall, reflect).

### Database

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `pg0` (embedded) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_READ_DATABASE_URL` | Optional read-replica PostgreSQL URL. When set, recall queries (semantic, BM25, graph, temporal) are routed through a separate connection pool against this URL, offloading the primary. Typically points to a read-only endpoint (e.g., CNPG's `<cluster>-ro` service or Aurora reader endpoint). | Unset (uses primary) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` | Direct PostgreSQL URL for running migrations, bypassing connection poolers (e.g. PgBouncer). When set, advisory locks and Alembic migrations use this URL instead of `DATABASE_URL`. | Falls back to `DATABASE_URL` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DATABASE_SCHEMA` | PostgreSQL schema name for tables | `public` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_STARTUP` | Run database migrations on API startup | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MIGRATION_ISOLATION` | Run migrations in a subprocess instead of in the calling process: `true` (keeps Alembic's import graph and its psycopg2 sync engine out of a long-lived server process) or `false` | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MIGRATION_CONCURRENCY` | Number of tenant schemas to migrate concurrently (PostgreSQL only). Each schema runs in its own process; within a schema migrations are always sequential. Each worker has a fixed startup cost (~1–2s to boot a fresh interpreter), so this only pays off with **many** schemas (roughly tens or more) or slow/high-latency migrations — for a handful of schemas it is slower than sequential. Each worker uses ~3 database connections, so keep `concurrency × 3` within your database's spare `max_connections` (and any PgBouncer pool limit). `1` = fully sequential. Measured at 20k schemas: the per-restart no-op resweep dropped from ~60min to ~11min (≈5×) at `concurrency=12`. | `1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EXTERNALLY_OWNED_ROUTINES` | Comma-separated list of maintenance discovery routines this deployment installs itself (see [Owning a maintenance routine](#owning-a-maintenance-routine)). Migrations skip anything named here. | Empty (every routine installed) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DATABASE_BACKEND` | Database engine backend: `postgresql` or `oracle` (Oracle 23ai) | `postgresql` |

If not provided, the server uses embedded `pg0` — convenient for development but not recommended for production.

To run against Oracle Database 23ai instead, set `HINDSIGHT_API_DATABASE_BACKEND=oracle` and use an `oracle+oracledb://…` URL. See the [Oracle Database guide](./oracle) for full setup instructions.

The `DATABASE_SCHEMA` setting allows you to use a custom PostgreSQL schema instead of the default `public` schema. This is useful for:
- Multi-database setups where you want Hindsight tables in a dedicated schema
- Hosting platforms (e.g., Supabase) where `public` schema is reserved or shared
- Organizational preferences for schema naming conventions

```bash
# Example: Using a custom schema
export HINDSIGHT_API_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
export HINDSIGHT_API_DATABASE_SCHEMA=hindsight
```

Migrations will automatically create the schema if it doesn't exist and create all tables in the configured schema.

#### Owning a maintenance routine

The background maintenance loop finds work by calling four PostgreSQL routines —
`mental_models_with_cron`, `banks_needing_consolidation`, `schemas_with_expired_rows` and
`schemas_with_expired_operations`. The stock implementations scan every schema in the
database on each tick. On a large multi-tenant install that is a serial loop over
thousands of schemas, repeated once per tick in every process running the loop.

Because they are called by name, you can replace one with an implementation suited to
your installation — typically a registry table maintained by a row trigger, so discovery
costs one indexed read instead of a scan. List the ones you have replaced and migrations
will leave them alone:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_EXTERNALLY_OWNED_ROUTINES=mental_models_with_cron,banks_needing_consolidation
```

Read from the environment of whatever process runs the migration, so it applies equally to
`hindsight-admin run-db-migration`, a migration Job, and migrate-on-startup.

Without this, your replacement survives only until the next migration that reinstalls the
routine: they are all `CREATE OR REPLACE` against the same name, so the migration wins and
nothing records that a custom implementation was discarded.

A few things to know:

- **Your replacement must match the stock signature.** The loop calls these with fixed
  arguments and reads fixed columns back.
- **Nothing verifies that a replacement exists.** Naming a routine you have not installed
  leaves whatever was there before — nothing, on a fresh database — and the maintenance
  loop then fails on the missing function rather than quietly running the scan you were
  trying to avoid.
- **Ownership is not stamped into the database.** Remove a name from the list and the next
  migration reinstalls the stock routine, with no data fix-up.
- **Empty by default.** An installation that has not replaced anything is unaffected.

### Database Connection Pool

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_POOL_MIN_SIZE` | Minimum connections in the primary pool | `5` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE` | Maximum connections in the primary pool | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_READ_DB_POOL_MIN_SIZE` | Minimum connections in the read-replica pool (only used when `READ_DATABASE_URL` is set) | Falls back to `DB_POOL_MIN_SIZE` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_READ_DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE` | Maximum connections in the read-replica pool (only used when `READ_DATABASE_URL` is set) | Falls back to `DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_COMMAND_TIMEOUT` | PostgreSQL command timeout in seconds (asyncpg client-side) | `60` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT` | Connection acquisition timeout in seconds. Bounds how long a caller waits for a free pool connection before failing (retried by the caller); `0` waits indefinitely. | `30` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT` | Postgres `statement_timeout` applied to every pool connection, in seconds. Server-side safety net for runaway queries. Does **not** apply to Alembic migrations (which run on a separate psycopg2 engine). Set to `0` to disable. | `600` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_MAX_PARALLEL_WORKERS_PER_GATHER` | Optional Postgres `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` applied to every pool connection of this process. Unset leaves the server default. Set to `0` on background-worker processes so bulk maintenance queries (consolidation, graph upkeep) run serially instead of fanning out across CPU cores shared with latency-sensitive traffic. | unset |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_SESSION_SETUP_ON_ACQUIRE` | Whether the per-connection session settings above (`statement_timeout`, `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`, the trigram threshold, the vector-search tuning, and — on the `vchord` text-search backend — the search path) are re-applied every time a connection is taken from the pool, not only when it is first opened. Keep this on unless the same settings are already pinned on the database role or the database itself (`ALTER ROLE … SET`), because behind a transaction-mode connection pooler an acquire can be linked to a server connection that never received them (on a direct connection they now survive, so the re-apply is redundant there) — with the re-apply off and nothing pinned server-side, reused connections quietly run without them, and on `vchord` recall fails outright rather than merely degrading. When they *are* pinned server-side the re-apply changes nothing and only costs a round trip per acquire, which is worth reclaiming on busy deployments behind a transaction-mode connection pooler. `application_name` is always re-applied and is unaffected by this setting. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENTITY_TRGM_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` | Postgres `pg_trgm.similarity_threshold` applied to every pool connection, governing how close a name must be for entity resolution's `%` trigram match to treat it as a candidate. Must be between `0` (exclusive) and `1`. Lower catches more substring-ish matches at higher CPU cost on large entity sets; higher is stricter and cheaper. | `0.15` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENTITY_INTRABATCH_MERGE_SIMILARITY` | Trigram similarity (pg_trgm-equivalent, computed in-memory) at/above which two brand-new names created by the **same** retain are merged into a single entity (in-batch dedup of surface-form variants — e.g. the same name with different emoji/case/suffix). Must be between `0` (exclusive) and `1`. This is a *merge* cutoff, deliberately stricter than the recall-only threshold above; raise it toward `1.0` to merge only near-identical forms. | `0.5` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENTITY_MERGE_MIN_SIMILARITY` | Minimum trigram similarity a name must have with an **existing** entity before that entity can be reused for it, whatever the other resolution signals say. Sits between the recall threshold above (`0.15`, which only decides what is *considered*) and the same-batch fold-in cutoff below (`0.5`). Must be between `0` (exclusive) and `1`. Lower it for corpora of very short names, where trigram similarity is unavoidably low (`Jon`/`John` is `0.29`); raise it to merge only clear surface variants. | `0.3` |

For high-concurrency workloads, increase `DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE`. Each concurrent recall/think operation can use 2-4 connections.

To run migrations manually (e.g., before starting the API), use the admin CLI:

```bash
# Migrate the base schema plus all discovered tenant schemas
hindsight-admin run-db-migration

# Or migrate a specific schema only:
hindsight-admin run-db-migration --schema tenant_acme
```

### Vector Extension

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_VECTOR_EXTENSION` | Vector index algorithm: `pgvector`, `vchord`, `pgvectorscale`, or `scann` | `pgvector` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ANN_ITERATIVE_SCAN` | Let a vector index scan resume until the query's `LIMIT` is satisfied, instead of stopping when its first candidate list drains. With it off, a recall can never retrieve more rows than that list holds — on pgvector, `hnsw.ef_search` (200) — so a larger recall budget widens the SQL and retrieves nothing extra. Requires pgvector 0.8.0+; older servers reject the setting and it is dropped automatically after the first attempt. This is the operational kill switch: setting it to `false` and restarting restores the previous retrieval depth exactly, with no code change. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ANN_MAX_SCAN_TUPLES` | Ceiling on how many tuples a single resumed scan may visit (`hnsw.max_scan_tuples`). This is the knob that governs what iterative scans cost: the filters that thin a result — the similarity floor, tags, date ranges — are applied *after* the index scan, so a selective query resumes repeatedly, and this bounds both the CPU it can spend and the memory it can hold (pgvector otherwise caps the latter at `work_mem × hnsw.scan_mem_multiplier`, which at this default is never approached). Lower it to trade retrieval depth back for latency; the initial scan is not counted, so even `1` leaves the pre-existing depth intact. pgvector's own default is `20000`. Ignored when iterative scans are off. | `4000` |

Hindsight supports four PostgreSQL vector extensions:

#### **pgvector** (HNSW - default)
- In-memory index using Hierarchical Navigable Small World algorithm
- Works well for most embeddings and dataset sizes
- Fast for small-medium datasets (&lt;10M vectors)
- Higher memory usage for large datasets
- Most widely deployed and supported

#### **pgvectorscale** (DiskANN - recommended for scale) ⭐
- Disk-based index using StreamingDiskANN algorithm
- **28x lower p95 latency** and **16x higher throughput** vs dedicated vector DBs
- **60-75% cost reduction** at scale (SSDs cheaper than RAM)
- Superior filtering performance with streaming retrieval model
- Optimized for large datasets (10M+ vectors)
- Supports both **pgvectorscale** (open source) and **pg_diskann** (Azure)
- **Installation:**
  - Open source/self-hosted: `CREATE EXTENSION vector; CREATE EXTENSION vectorscale CASCADE;`
  - Azure PostgreSQL: `CREATE EXTENSION vector; CREATE EXTENSION pg_diskann CASCADE;`

#### **vchord** (vchordrq)
- Alternative high-performance vector index
- Optimized for high-dimensional embeddings (3000+ dimensions)
- Includes integrated BM25 search capabilities
- Requires `vchord` extension

#### **scann** (AlloyDB ScaNN)
- Google's ScaNN index, available on **AlloyDB** and **AlloyDB Omni**
- Uses a single global vector index in `AUTO` mode (per-bank partial indexes are not used)
- **Installation:** `CREATE EXTENSION vector; CREATE EXTENSION alloydb_scann CASCADE;`
- **Index build is deferred** until a table reaches **10,000 populated embedding rows** — AlloyDB cannot build a ScaNN AUTO index on a near-empty table. Until that threshold is crossed, recall falls back to a sequential scan; the global index is built on the next API startup once enough rows exist.
- A ready-to-use Docker Compose stack is provided at [`docker/docker-compose/alloydb/docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight/blob/main/docker/docker-compose/alloydb/docker-compose.yaml) for running Hindsight against AlloyDB Omni locally.

**When to use pgvectorscale (DiskANN):**
- Large datasets (10M+ vectors) ⭐
- Complex filtering requirements
- Cost-sensitive deployments
- Production workloads requiring high throughput
- When disk I/O is not a bottleneck

**When to use pgvector (HNSW):**
- Small-medium datasets (&lt;10M vectors)
- Maximum query speed when all data fits in memory
- Simple nearest-neighbor queries without filters
- Standard PostgreSQL deployment preference

**When to use vchord:**
- High-dimensional embeddings (3000+ dimensions)
- Want integrated BM25 search
- Already using vchord for text search

**When to use scann:**
- Running on Google **AlloyDB** or **AlloyDB Omni**
- Want managed ScaNN with `AUTO` mode tuning

#### Limiting vector indexes on large deployments

On `pgvector`, `pgvectorscale` and `vchord`, a bank's memories are indexed per
`(bank, fact_type)`. By default every bank gets its own indexes when it is
created, which is the right thing for most deployments and needs no
configuration.

It stops being the right thing when you have thousands of banks. These indexes
all live on one shared table, and PostgreSQL inspects and locks **every** index
on a table whenever it plans a query against it — so an index created for one
bank is a cost paid by searches in every other bank. Past a few thousand banks,
planning slows sharply and the server eventually runs out of lock-table space,
failing reads *and* bank deletion alike.

Setting a minimum size fixes that: a bank only gets its own indexes once it is
large enough to benefit from them. Below the threshold PostgreSQL answers the
same search from the `(bank_id, fact_type)` B-tree plus a top-N sort, which for
a small bank is both faster and *exact* rather than approximate — so small banks
lose nothing. The number of indexes becomes proportional to the number of
**large** banks rather than to the number of banks, and bank count stops being a
limit.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_VECTOR_INDEX_MIN_ROWS` | Memories a bank needs, in one fact type, before that fact type gets its own vector index. `0` (the default) turns the threshold **off**: every bank is indexed from the moment it is created. `10000` is a good starting point for deployments with thousands of banks. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_VECTOR_INDEX_MAINTENANCE_MIN_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | Shortest gap between two index-maintenance runs for one bank. Stops a bank whose size hovers at the threshold from building and dropping the same index repeatedly. Unused while the threshold is off. | `900` |

**With the threshold off (the default),** indexes are created inside the
transaction that creates the bank — instantly, because the bank is empty — and
dropped when the bank is deleted. Nothing inspects bank sizes, and no background
operation runs.

**With a threshold set,** bank creation, ingestion and import build no indexes at
all, so no request ever waits on index DDL. Instead, a write that could move a
bank across the threshold queues a background `vector_index_maintenance`
operation, which builds an index when a bank grows past the threshold and removes
it if the bank shrinks well below it (the gap between those two points prevents
churn at the boundary). You will see these operations in the bank's operations
list.

To reconcile without waiting for a write — after a restore, an upgrade, or an
extension switch — run:

```bash
hindsight-admin repair-bank --all
```

This works in both modes: with the threshold off it rebuilds any index a bank is
missing, and with one set it also drops what a bank no longer earns.

**Switching extensions:**

If you need to switch from one extension to another:
1. Set `HINDSIGHT_API_VECTOR_EXTENSION` to your desired extension (`pgvector`, `vchord`, `pgvectorscale`, or `scann`)
2. If your database has existing data, you'll get an error with migration instructions (note: switching **to** `scann` is allowed even with data — the existing index is dropped and rebuilt as ScaNN once the table has at least 10,000 embedding rows)
3. For empty databases, indexes will be automatically recreated on startup

### Text Search Extension

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TEXT_SEARCH_EXTENSION` | Text search backend: `native`, `vchord`, `pg_textsearch`, `pgroonga`, or `pg_search` | `native` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TEXT_SEARCH_EXTENSION_NATIVE_LANGUAGE` | PostgreSQL text search dictionary used by the `native` backend (e.g. `english`, `french`, `simple`, `zhparser`) | `english` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TEXT_SEARCH_EXTENSION_PG_SEARCH_TOKENIZER` | ParadeDB `pg_search` tokenizer used when creating BM25 indexes. Empty uses ParadeDB's default tokenizer (`unicode_words`). | unset |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TEXT_SEARCH_EXTENSION_PG_SEARCH_FUNCTION_SCHEMA` | Schema containing ParadeDB `pg_search` functions (`score`, `boolean`, `match`). Default is `paradedb`; set to `pgsearch` (or another valid identifier) on managed PostgreSQL distributions that install functions under a custom schema. | `paradedb` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_BM25_MAX_QUERY_TERMS` | Cap on the number of terms in the native PostgreSQL BM25 `tsquery`. Long queries OR-join every normalized token, and because native ranking has no IDF and re-ranks every match, an uncapped query over common terms can scan and rank a large fraction of the bank and time out. When the query exceeds the cap, the most **selective** terms are kept — those with the lowest tenant-wide document frequency, read for free from `pg_stats` (autovacuum-maintained, no reindex) — so a blunt truncation doesn't discard the high-signal terms. `0` restores the historical uncapped behavior; the cap bounds only the `native` backend (other BM25 backends receive the raw query and rank via their own index-native operators). | `16` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_BM25_SELECTIVE_TERMS` | When the cap above trims a query, whether to keep the most **selective** terms (lowest document frequency, from `pg_stats`) rather than the first N. `true` is strictly better for recall at no extra cost when stats exist; set `false` to opt out of the catalog read and cap by position. Ignored when the cap is `0`. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_OUTPUT_LANGUAGE` | When set, forces every LLM-generated artifact (retain facts, consolidation observations, reflect responses) into this language. Free-form (e.g. `Spanish`, `Japanese`). | unset |

Hindsight supports five backends for BM25 keyword retrieval:
- **native** — PostgreSQL's built-in full-text search (`tsvector` + GIN). Language configurable.
- **vchord** — VectorChord BM25 (uses the `llmlingua2` multilingual tokenizer).
- **pg_textsearch** — Timescale's pg_textsearch extension. English-only.
- **pgroonga** — pgroonga full-text search. Multilingual / CJK out of the box.
- **pg_search** — ParadeDB pg_search. True BM25; the only backend that is Citus-compatible.

A bank can also use none of them: [`enable_text_search`](#recall-pipeline-stages)
switches the keyword arm off per bank, leaving pure vector search. Every setting in
this table is then unused by that bank.

To switch backends: set `HINDSIGHT_API_TEXT_SEARCH_EXTENSION`. With existing data, you'll get an error and migration instructions; with an empty database the columns/indexes are recreated automatically on startup.

`HINDSIGHT_API_TEXT_SEARCH_EXTENSION_PG_SEARCH_TOKENIZER` only applies when `HINDSIGHT_API_TEXT_SEARCH_EXTENSION=pg_search`, and only when BM25 indexes are created. Changing it for an existing database requires rebuilding the `pg_search` indexes or recreating the database. Supported values are empty/unset, `unicode_words`, `simple`, `whitespace`, `literal`, `literal_normalized`, `chinese_compatible`, `icu`, `jieba`, `source_code`, `chinese_lindera`/`lindera(chinese)`, `japanese_lindera`/`lindera(japanese)`, `korean_lindera`/`lindera(korean)`, `ngram(min,max)`, and `edge_ngram(min,max)`.

For non-English banks (especially CJK) and the language/extraction-language tradeoffs, see the [Multilingual Support](./multilingual) page.

### LLM Provider

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER` | Provider: `openai`, `openai-responses`, `openai-codex`, `claude-code`, `cursor`, `github-copilot`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `groq`, `minimax`, `deepseek`, `zai`, `opencode-go`, `meta`, `nous`, `xai-oauth`, `fireworks`, `ollama`, `ollama-cloud`, `lmstudio`, `llamacpp`, `vertexai`, `bedrock`, `litellm`, `litellmrouter`, `volcano`, `openrouter`, `requesty`, `none` | `openai` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY` | API key for providers that require one; unused by `github-copilot` | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MODEL` | Model name | `gpt-5-mini` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_BASE_URL` | Custom LLM endpoint | Provider default |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Max concurrent LLM requests | `32` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_RETRIES` | Max retry attempts for LLM API calls | `3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_INITIAL_BACKOFF` | Initial retry backoff in seconds (exponential backoff) | `1.0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_BACKOFF` | Max retry backoff cap in seconds | `60.0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TIMEOUT` | LLM request timeout in seconds. Honoured by every provider as a **total** deadline for one request, including the time spent reading a streamed response — a backend that keeps sending bytes is cut off at the deadline rather than read indefinitely. Raise it if your provider is legitimately slow; the per-operation variables below override it. | `120` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` | Ceiling on the **connect** phase (TCP + TLS handshake) of an LLM request, in seconds. The read, write and pool phases keep the full `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TIMEOUT` budget; capping connect separately means an unreachable or wedged endpoint fails in seconds instead of consuming the whole request timeout. Effective value is the smaller of this and the request timeout. Set to `0` to disable the cap and use one value across all four phases. Applies to every provider whose HTTP client Hindsight constructs (all OpenAI-compatible backends, `openai-responses`, `anthropic`, `openai-codex`, `xai-oauth`, `fireworks`, `nous`, `llamacpp`); `litellm`/`litellmrouter` and `gemini`/`vertexai` own their transports and take a single total deadline instead, and `claude-code`/`cursor`/`github-copilot` drive a CLI rather than a socket. | `10` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_HTTP_LOG_LEVEL` | Log level for the `httpx` and `httpcore` loggers. Set to `DEBUG` to trace each LLM request through its transport phases (`connect_tcp`, `send_request_headers`, `receive_response_headers`) — the way to tell a request that stalled before it was ever sent from one that was sent and never answered. Verbose; for diagnosis only. | `WARNING` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` | Reasoning effort for providers/models that support it (for example `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`). Set it and the value is sent as given, whatever your model is called — which is how you control thinking-token volume on a self-hosted reasoning model (vLLM, Ollama, llama.cpp, TGI), where `none` is often the only value that removes the thinking block. Leave it unset and no reasoning parameter is sent at all, so each model runs at its own default effort. Honoured by `openai` and every OpenAI-compatible provider, `openai-responses`, `openai-codex`, `xai`, `llamacpp`, and `litellm`/`litellmrouter` (which translate it per target provider). The native `gemini`/`vertexai`, `anthropic`, `claude-code` and `cursor` providers have no reasoning-effort control and log a warning at startup if you set one — reach those models through `litellm` to apply it. | Unset (model's own default) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE` | Global override for the sampling temperature of internal LLM calls. Set a number in `[0.0, 2.0]`, or `none` (also `default`/`off`/empty) to **omit** the temperature parameter entirely — required for models that reject explicit temperatures, e.g. Azure `gpt-5.5`, which only accepts its default value. Per-operation variables below override this. | Per-operation defaults |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE_VERIFICATION` | Temperature for the startup connection check. Number in `[0.0, 2.0]` or `none` to omit. Overrides `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE`. | `0.0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE_RETAIN` | Temperature for fact extraction during retain. Number in `[0.0, 2.0]` or `none` to omit. Overrides `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE`. | `0.1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE_REFLECT` | Temperature for the reflect "thinking" step. Number in `[0.0, 2.0]` or `none` to omit. Overrides `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE`. | `0.9` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE_CONSOLIDATION` | Temperature for consolidation (mental-model delta and dedup). Number in `[0.0, 2.0]` or `none` to omit. Overrides `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE`. | `0.0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_VISION` | Whether the configured LLM can read images, overriding what the provider reports about itself. Leave unset and each provider answers for itself: Anthropic and Gemini report yes, OpenAI reports yes, `none` reports no, and every gateway-style backend (LiteLLM, Ollama, LM Studio, OpenRouter, an OpenAI-compatible proxy) reports *unknown*, because its catalogue mixes vision-capable and text-only models. A retain carrying [inline attachments](#inline-attachments-in-retain) is refused with `422` on both "no" and "unknown" — dropping an attachment silently would leave a document that looks retained with the information the caller cared about gone. Set `true` when you are running a vision model behind such a gateway; set `false` to refuse images against an endpoint that rejects them despite its model name. | Provider decides |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_VLM_PROVIDER` | Provider for the **vision slot** — the model used only for retain chunks that carry an [inline attachment](#inline-attachments-in-retain). Every text-only chunk keeps using the retain LLM, so a bank whose documents mostly *are* text does not pay a vision model's price for all of it. Unset, attachments go to the retain LLM. | Retain LLM |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_VLM_API_KEY` | API key for the vision slot. | Retain LLM's |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_VLM_MODEL` | Model for the vision slot. This is the model `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_VISION` and the `422` vision check apply to, since it is the one that will actually be handed the attachment. | Retain LLM's |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_VLM_BASE_URL` | Base URL for the vision slot. Follows `HINDSIGHT_API_VLM_PROVIDER`'s own default when that is set and this is not — it never inherits the retain provider's host, which would send the request to the wrong endpoint with the wrong key. | Provider default |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_SEND_BANK_AS_USER` | Tag outbound LLM and embedding calls with `user=<bank_id>` so gateways (OpenRouter usage accounting, LiteLLM, Helicone) can attribute spend per bank. When enabled, the bank id is transmitted to the upstream provider as the end-user identifier. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_GROQ_SERVICE_TIER` | Groq service tier: `on_demand`, `flex`, `auto` | `auto` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_OPENAI_SERVICE_TIER` | OpenAI service tier: `flex` for 50% cost savings (OpenAI Flex Processing) | None (default) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_BEDROCK_SERVICE_TIER` | Bedrock service tier: `flex` for 50% cost savings (best-effort inference), `priority` (guaranteed throughput), or `reserved` (provisioned capacity) | Unset (default tier) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_GEMINI_SERVICE_TIER` | Gemini service tier: `flex` for 50% cost savings (best-effort inference) | Unset (default tier) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_EXTRA_BODY` | JSON dict of extra request-body params (e.g. `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`) merged into every LLM call. Applied across the OpenAI-compatible, Fireworks, Anthropic, Gemini/VertexAI and LiteLLM (incl. Bedrock/Router) providers. Each provider merges them in its own native parameter space, so use that provider's field names (e.g. `max_tokens` for OpenAI/Anthropic vs `max_output_tokens` for Gemini). The native Ollama structured-output path is a special case — see the note below. Also useful for custom model servers (e.g. vLLM `chat_template_kwargs`). | `null` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_DEFAULT_HEADERS` | JSON dict passed as `default_headers` to provider SDK clients. Used by operators routing through proxies / request-tracing middleware (e.g. Cloudflare AI Gateway, Helicone, corporate proxies). Wired into the Anthropic provider, the OpenAI-compatible providers, Fireworks, Nous, the OpenAI Responses API, and the LiteLLM-backed providers (`litellm`, `litellmrouter`, `bedrock`); other providers can opt in. | `null` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_CACHE_AFFINITY` | Pin a conversation to one backend prompt cache on the OpenAI-compatible providers, Fireworks and Nous. Server-side prompt caches are per backend server, so the same conversation has to reach the same one for a cache hit. `xai_conv_id` sends xAI's documented `x-grok-conv-id` header; `openai_prompt_cache_key` sends OpenAI's `prompt_cache_key` field; `auto` picks one from the configured base URL host (x.ai / grok.com &rarr; `xai_conv_id`; native OpenAI or an openai.com host &rarr; `openai_prompt_cache_key`; anything else, including Azure OpenAI, &rarr; `none`); `none` sends nothing. The id is the operation's trace id, so every LLM call of one retain/reflect/consolidation run shares it. `auto` is an allowlist rather than a best-effort probe, so an unknown OpenAI-compatible backend (vLLM, ollama, groq, openrouter, a custom proxy) receives byte-identical requests to before; set `none` to disable entirely. Anthropic and Gemini/Vertex do their own caching and ignore this. | `auto` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA` | Grammar-enforce structured output via `json_schema` `strict: true` instead of the soft "schema-in-prompt + `json_object`" path. Typed Pydantic response models are serialized directly into the OpenAI strict subset: every object rejects additional properties, every declared property is required, and nullable fields remain nullable. Use it with weaker self-hosted models that return prose preambles, markdown ` ```json ` fences, or invalid JSON — which otherwise fail to parse and wedge retain/consolidation. Applies to OpenAI-compatible backends (OpenAI, LM Studio, Ollama, Volcano, llama.cpp, vLLM), Codex, and LiteLLM; Gemini already enforces its native `response_schema` regardless, and providers without a strict mode ignore it. LM Studio, Ollama, and Volcano are the most common cases: their soft path skips even `json_object` mode (they don't honor it reliably), so a small model's raw output goes unconstrained — enabling this flag is the fix for a `JSONDecodeError` during retain on those backends. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA_RETAIN` | Override `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA` for retain (fact extraction) only. Applies to both the streaming and batch extraction paths. | Inherits global |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA_REFLECT` | Override `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA` for reflect's structured-output extraction and a mental model's delta-refresh operations. | Inherits global |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA_CONSOLIDATION` | Override `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA` for consolidation only (both the batch consolidation call and observation dedup). | Inherits global |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_SUPPORTS_MAX_ITEMS` | Whether the LLM backend accepts JSON Schema `maxItems` in structured-output schemas. Set to `false` for backends such as Bedrock Converse that reject this keyword; consolidation still enforces observation caps after parsing. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_SUPPORTS_STRING_PATTERN` | Whether the LLM backend accepts JSON Schema `pattern` in structured-output schemas. When `true`, retain constrains `occurred_start` / `occurred_end` to an ISO timestamp, which stops a grammar-constrained model from reasoning inside the timestamp string — a failure that corrupts the date and can burn the entire completion budget on an unterminated response. Left `false` because support is narrow and rejection is a hard 400 at request time: Bedrock validates schemas against an allowlist that excludes this keyword, and OpenAI errors on unsupported keywords under `strict`. Backends that neither enforce nor reject it gain nothing. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_FORCED_TOOL` | Request structured output from the LiteLLM-backed providers (`litellm`, `litellmrouter`, `bedrock`) with a single forced tool call — the response schema becomes the tool's parameters — instead of `response_format`. Set to `true` for backends that reject `response_format` outright. This is region-dependent on Bedrock Claude: `ap-southeast-2` (`au.*` inference profiles) refuses the translated Converse `outputConfig` with `Extra inputs are not permitted`, while the same model in `us-east-1` (`us.*`) accepts it and needs nothing here. Verified against both. If the model answers without calling the tool, the reply is parsed as text as before. Other providers ignore it. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_CODEX_HOME` | Credentials directory for the `openai-codex` provider — the directory holding the `auth.json` it authenticates with. Overrides the process-wide `CODEX_HOME` for Hindsight's own LLM calls. Its reason to exist is that `CODEX_HOME` is process-wide: set this (and the per-member `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_CODEX_HOME`) to run two independently authorized ChatGPT profiles in one process, so a [multi-LLM chain](#multi-llm-strategies-failover--round-robin) of two Codex members can fail over between accounts. | Unset (`CODEX_HOME`, else `~/.codex`) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_OLLAMA_NUM_CTX` | Optional native Ollama `num_ctx` override. Leave unset to use the model/server default; set a positive integer only when you need a larger context window. Setting it also routes free-form calls (including the startup connection probe) through the native `/api/chat` API, since the OpenAI-compatible endpoint cannot express a context size — see the note below. | Unset |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_GEMINI_SAFETY_SETTINGS` | JSON-encoded list of `{category, threshold}` dicts for Gemini/VertexAI content safety filtering | `null` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROMPT_CACHE_ENABLED` | Reuse the fixed system prefix via the provider's explicit prompt cache, billed at the cached-input rate (Gemini/Vertex `CachedContent`). The cached prefix is shared across all banks and soft-fails to an uncached call. Set to `false` to disable. See [Models](./models#provider-capabilities). | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_PROMPT_CACHE_ENABLED` | For reflect specifically, roll a step-by-step context cache forward through the agent's tool loop so each turn reuses the whole prior conversation (system + tools + all prior tool results) at the cached-input rate instead of only the static prefix. Requires `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROMPT_CACHE_ENABLED`. The per-reflect caches are ephemeral and deleted when the reflect ends. Set to `false` to run reflect uncached while leaving prompt caching on elsewhere. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_DEBUG_DUMP_4XX` | Diagnostic: when enabled, on any LLM `4xx` the provider logs `[LLM_4XX_DUMP]` with the request as actually assembled — the serialized request config (response schema + generation params, message bodies stripped) and length-capped per-message previews — so an otherwise-unreproducible rejected request can be inspected. Wired into all remote providers (Gemini/Vertex, OpenAI-compatible incl. Fireworks/Nous, Anthropic, LiteLLM incl. Router, Codex). Off by default; leave off in normal operation. | `false` |

When `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama`, Hindsight no longer sends the previous native API default `num_ctx=16384` unless you set it explicitly. To keep the old request behavior, set `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_OLLAMA_NUM_CTX=16384`; otherwise Ollama uses the model Modelfile or server default.

**When Hindsight uses Ollama's native API.** Structured-output calls always use the native `/api/chat` API, for schema enforcement. Free-form calls join them as soon as `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_OLLAMA_NUM_CTX` is set, because Ollama's OpenAI-compatible handler parses a fixed set of fields and drops the rest — there is no way to express `num_ctx` on `/v1/chat/completions`, nested under `options` or otherwise. That matters on a shared Ollama host: Ollama keys a loaded model instance by context size, so a call at the server default reloads the model and re-tunes it for every other consumer.

**`HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_EXTRA_BODY` on the native Ollama path.** The native request body has *two tiers* — this differs from the OpenAI-compatible endpoint, where the SDK flattens everything to top-level. On the native path `extra_body` is split accordingly:

- **Top-level native fields** (`think`, `keep_alive`, ...) pass through directly. For example, gpt-oss models require a thinking level for structured extraction, so set `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_EXTRA_BODY='{"think": "low"}'` (thinking is disabled by default).
- **Generation parameters** (`seed`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `num_ctx`, `temperature`, ...) live under Ollama's `options` object, so nest them: `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_EXTRA_BODY='{"options": {"seed": 42, "top_p": 0.9}}'`. On the OpenAI-compatible endpoints these same params are top-level instead.

### SuperGrok OAuth (`xai-oauth`)

`HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=xai-oauth` authenticates with a SuperGrok subscription via
device-code OAuth instead of an API key. Log in once with
`python -m hindsight_api.engine.providers.xai_oauth_auth login`; the grant is stored on disk
and refreshed automatically. Every variable below is optional — the defaults match the
vendor's own client, so a normal deployment sets none of them.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_XAI_OAUTH_TOKEN_PATH` | Where the OAuth grant is stored. Both the login and the refresh follow it, so this relocates the store rather than overriding only the read. | `~/.hindsight/xai_oauth.json` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_XAI_OAUTH_BASE_URL` | Deployment-wide endpoint override. Takes precedence over `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_BASE_URL`, which deployments often set for an unrelated proxy. | `https://api.x.ai/v1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_XAI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth client id used at login and refresh. | xAI's published Grok CLI client |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_XAI_OAUTH_SCOPE` | Scope string requested at login. | vendor default |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_XAI_OAUTH_REFRESH_SKEW_SECONDS` | How long before expiry a token counts as due for refresh. Widen it if this deployment calls the provider rarely (a cron or gateway shape). | `60` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_XAI_OAUTH_REFRESH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Per-request timeout for discovery, device-code and refresh calls. | `20` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_XAI_OAUTH_DEBUG_HEADERS` | Log an allowlist of response headers (`via`, `x-request-id`, `cf-ray`, `server`, `date`) on a non-2xx reply. Diagnostic only; never logs credentials, cookies or bodies. | `false` |

This is the subscription lane, not xAI API-key support — for `api.x.ai` with an API key use
`HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=openai` with `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.x.ai/v1`.

### LLM Router (LiteLLM Router)

`HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=litellmrouter` runs the default LLM through [LiteLLM's `Router`](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/routing). The config JSON is forwarded verbatim — for fallback chains, load-balancing, rate limits, routing strategies, and the rest of the supported keys, see the [LiteLLM Router docs](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/routing). Hindsight always issues completions against `model_name: "default"`, so include at least one entry with that name.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_LITELLMROUTER_CONFIG` | JSON object passed to `litellm.Router(**config)`. Required when provider is `litellmrouter`. |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_{RETAIN,REFLECT,CONSOLIDATION}_LLM_LITELLMROUTER_CONFIG` | Per-operation overrides. Fall back to the default config when unset. |

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=litellmrouter
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_LITELLMROUTER_CONFIG='{
  "model_list": [
    {"model_name": "default",  "litellm_params": {"model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "api_key": "sk-..."}},
    {"model_name": "fallback", "litellm_params": {"model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "api_key": "sk-ant-..."}}
  ],
  "fallbacks": [{"default": ["fallback"]}]
}'
```

The config is a credential field — never returned by the bank-config API. Hindsight already retries calls; set `"num_retries": 0` in the Router config to avoid double-retries. Batch APIs aren't supported in router mode.

### Multi-LLM Strategies (failover / round-robin)

Configure additional LLMs **by index** alongside the primary, then choose a strategy for routing across them. This is a provider-agnostic alternative to the LiteLLM Router: the indexed LLMs can be any mix of providers, each fully configured.

The unindexed `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_*` config is the **primary** (member 1). Extra members are numbered from 1:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_PROVIDER` | Provider for extra member `n` (`n` = 1, 2, ...). Presence of this var defines the member; indices must be contiguous from 1. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_API_KEY` | API key for member `n` (required unless the provider needs none). | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_MODEL` | Model for member `n`. | Provider default |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_BASE_URL` | Base URL for member `n`. | Provider default |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_REASONING_EFFORT` | Reasoning effort for member `n`. | `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_EXTRA_BODY` / `_DEFAULT_HEADERS` | Per-member JSON overrides. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_BEDROCK_SERVICE_TIER` / `_GEMINI_SERVICE_TIER` | Per-member service tier. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_VERTEXAI_PROJECT_ID` / `_VERTEXAI_REGION` / `_VERTEXAI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` | Per-member Vertex AI project, region, and service-account key path (for a `vertexai` member). Each falls back to the global `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_VERTEXAI_*` when unset. | Global / `us-central1` / ADC |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_CODEX_HOME` | Per-member Codex credentials directory — the directory holding the `auth.json` this member authenticates with (for an `openai-codex` member). Set it so two Codex members run as two independently authorized ChatGPT profiles; without it every member resolves the same store. Falls back to the global `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_CODEX_HOME`, then `CODEX_HOME`, then `~/.codex`. | Global / `CODEX_HOME` / `~/.codex` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_LITELLMROUTER_CONFIG` | Per-member LiteLLM Router config JSON (for a `litellmrouter` member). Falls back to the global `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_LITELLMROUTER_CONFIG` when unset. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_TIMEOUT` | Per-member request timeout, in seconds. Falls back to the operation's timeout when unset. | Operation timeout |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_MAX_RETRIES` | Per-member retry budget. Falls back to the operation's `MAX_RETRIES` when unset; `0` is a valid setting and means fail over immediately. | Operation `MAX_RETRIES` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRATEGY` | JSON routing strategy across the chain. Unset = single primary LLM (no change). | - |

The strategy JSON supports three modes:

- `{"mode": "failover"}` — try members in order (primary first); on a member's failure (after its own retries) advance to the next.
- `{"mode": "round-robin"}` — rotate the starting member per request to spread load, then fall through the rest on failure. Add `"weights": [3, 1, ...]` (positive ints, one per member, primary first) for an **unbalanced** rotation.
- `{"mode": "metadata", "routes": [...]}` — **retain only**: pick the member from each retained item's own `metadata`. See [Metadata routing](#metadata-routing) below.

```bash
# Primary OpenAI, failover to Groq then Anthropic
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_1_PROVIDER=groq
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_1_API_KEY=gsk-...
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_2_PROVIDER=anthropic
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_2_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRATEGY='{"mode": "failover"}'

# Weighted round-robin: serve the primary 3x as often as member 1
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRATEGY='{"mode": "round-robin", "weights": [3, 1]}'
```

#### Metadata routing

`{"mode": "metadata"}` sends each retained item to the chain member its own metadata selects, so one deployment can extract different documents with different models:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_1_PROVIDER=ollama
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_1_MODEL=qwen3:8b
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRATEGY='{
  "mode": "metadata",
  "routes": [{"key": "classification", "value": "sensitive", "member": 1}]
}'
```

Retaining `{"content": "...", "metadata": {"classification": "sensitive"}}` extracts facts on the local `qwen3:8b`; everything else uses the primary.

- **Routes are matched per item, in declared order — the first match wins.** An item that matches no route uses member `0` (the primary).
- **Values are compared as strings**, because retain metadata is free-form JSON and route values come from an env var: `"member": 1` matches metadata `1` and `"1"`. A list value matches if any entry does, so `{"labels": ["pii", "eu"]}` matches a route on `labels` = `pii`.
- **Nothing is stored.** The selection is made when the item's extraction prompt is built and is not persisted, so changing the routes changes only future retains. Reprocessing a document replays its original metadata and therefore re-routes the same way.
- **Each retain item is one extraction prompt**, so a batch mixing differently routed items is fine — every item goes to its own member.

**What this does not do.** Metadata routing chooses *which model extracts a document*. It is not a data boundary: the facts extracted from a routed document are stored in the same bank as everything else, and recall, reflect, consolidation, mental-model refresh and dry-run extraction all continue to use the primary LLM. If you need a document's content kept away from a provider entirely, use a separate bank with a per-bank LLM configuration instead.

Two further limits:

- **`update_mode: "append"` routes on the metadata supplied with the append call**, not the stored document's. An append re-extracts the stored body together with the new text, so resupply the same metadata to keep it on the same member.
- **Batch retain is not supported** with this mode. `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_ENABLED=true` submits every item of an operation as a single job to a single member, which cannot honour per-item routes, so the combination is rejected at startup.

**Per-operation chains.** Each operation can define its own members + strategy with the `RETAIN` / `REFLECT` / `CONSOLIDATION` / `MENTAL_MODEL_REFRESH` prefix (e.g. `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_1_PROVIDER`, `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_STRATEGY`). A per-operation slot with no indexed members (or no strategy) inherits the global chain — except `MENTAL_MODEL_REFRESH`, which inherits the reflect chain.

The indexed members are credential fields — never returned by the bank-config API and server-level only (not per-bank configurable). **Batch retain** runs on the first batch-capable member in declared order, which need not be the primary — so a chain whose primary has no batch API can still use `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_ENABLED=true` as long as one member supports it. That member serves the whole batch (submit, polling and retrieval all target the account that holds it), so batch does not fail over the way the interactive retain/reflect/consolidation calls do. An in-flight batch is bound to the account that submitted it, so if the worker restarts mid-batch it resumes on that same account even when the chain has since been reordered or extended. Removing that member — or rotating its API key — while a batch is still running makes the operation fail with an explicit error instead of polling a different account.

**Retries inside a chain.** A failover chain is itself a retry: when a member
fails, the next one is tried. Retrying a non-terminal member first only delays
that handoff, and when it is failing because it is saturated the immediate
retry is likely to fail the same way. The last member is the opposite case —
it has nowhere to fail over to, so its retry budget is the only thing between a
transient error and a failed request, and it is where honouring a `Retry-After`
pays. A single operation-wide `MAX_RETRIES` cannot express both, so set
`HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_RETRIES=0` to fail over promptly and give the final
member its own budget with `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_MAX_RETRIES`.

### Built-in llama.cpp

The `llamacpp` provider runs a llama.cpp server as a managed subprocess — no external LLM server needed. On first run it auto-downloads a default GGUF model (~3.5 GB) into `~/.hindsight/models`. Requires the `local-llm` extra: `pip install 'hindsight-api-slim[local-llm]'`.

> **⚠️ Not available in the Docker image**
>
The published `ghcr.io/vectorize-io/hindsight` image deliberately leaves llama.cpp out, so `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=llamacpp` cannot run there — it fails immediately with a message telling you so.

For local inference in Docker, run llama.cpp as its own container and point Hindsight at its OpenAI-compatible API with `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=openai` and `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_BASE_URL`. A ready-to-run setup is in [`docker/docker-compose/local-llm/`](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight/tree/main/docker/docker-compose/local-llm).
| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_MODEL_PATH` | Path to a GGUF model file. If not set, auto-downloads `gemma-4-E2B-it-Q4_K_M` from HuggingFace. | Auto-download |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_GPU_LAYERS` | Number of layers to offload to GPU. `-1` = all layers (recommended). `0` = CPU only. | `-1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_CONTEXT_SIZE` | Context window size in tokens. | `8192` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_CHAT_FORMAT` | Chat template format. `null` = auto-detect from GGUF metadata (recommended). | Auto-detect |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_NO_GRAMMAR` | Disable JSON grammar enforcement. Faster inference but less reliable JSON output. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_EXTRA_ARGS` | Space-separated extra CLI args passed to the llama.cpp server (e.g. `--n_threads 8 --type_k 1`). | - |

```bash
# Minimal setup (auto-downloads model, uses GPU)
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=llamacpp

# Custom model with tuning
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=llamacpp
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT=2
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_MODEL_PATH=~/.hindsight/models/my-model.gguf
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_CONTEXT_SIZE=16384
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_NO_GRAMMAR=true  # faster, less reliable JSON
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_EXTRA_ARGS="--n_threads 8"
```

> **📝 Note**
>
The llama.cpp server is shared across all LLM operations (retain, reflect, consolidation). Set `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT=2` to allow retain and consolidation to run concurrently without blocking each other.

Auto-downloaded models land in `~/.hindsight/models`. Keep that directory on persistent storage — if it is discarded between restarts, every restart re-downloads the full model.
### Per-Operation LLM Configuration

Different memory operations have different requirements. **Retain** (fact extraction) benefits from models with strong structured output capabilities, while **Reflect** (reasoning/response generation) can use lighter, faster models. Configure separate LLM models for each operation to optimize for cost and performance.

| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_MAX_BACKOFF` | Max backoff cap for reflect retries (seconds) | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_BACKOFF` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_TIMEOUT` | Timeout for reflect requests (seconds). Reflect answers a caller who is holding an HTTP request open and makes several sequential LLM calls, so its default is shorter than the global one — one stalled call must not outlive the caller. | `30`, or `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TIMEOUT` when that is set explicitly |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` | Reasoning effort for reflect operations | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` |

| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` | Transport-level output cap (`max_completion_tokens`) for reflect's final synthesis call. Unset means uncapped: the model runs to a natural stop and the reflect/mental-model `max_tokens` governs *visible* length via a prompt directive plus a post-hoc rewrite, not by truncating the provider call. On thinking models the raw provider budget is consumed by reasoning tokens, so a hard cap here would cut pages off mid-word. Set an integer only to enforce a hard cost ceiling on the synthesis call. | Unset (uncapped) |

| `HINDSIGHT_API_MENTAL_MODEL_REFRESH_LLM_PROVIDER` | LLM provider for the automatic mental-model refresh | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_PROVIDER` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MENTAL_MODEL_REFRESH_LLM_API_KEY` | API key for the refresh LLM | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_API_KEY` |

| `HINDSIGHT_API_MENTAL_MODEL_REFRESH_LLM_MAX_RETRIES` | Max retries for the refresh | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_MAX_RETRIES` |

| `HINDSIGHT_API_MENTAL_MODEL_REFRESH_LLM_TIMEOUT` | Timeout for refresh requests (seconds). Nobody is waiting on a background refresh, so this is usually set much higher than the reflect timeout. | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_TIMEOUT` |

**Automatic mental-model refresh.** The background refresh that runs after consolidation
drives the same agent as interactive reflect, so by default it uses the reflect LLM and
nothing above needs setting. The `MENTAL_MODEL_REFRESH_LLM_*` group exists because the two
want opposite tradeoffs on a single-GPU self-hosted box: interactive reflect favours a
reasoning model (a human is waiting on the quality), while the background refresh favours
a fast no-think model that cannot blow the wall timeout, cannot exceed the completion-token
budget on a reasoning chain, and does not halve interactive decode speed by running
alongside it. Every field falls back to its `REFLECT_LLM_*` counterpart, which in turn falls
back to the global `LLM_*` — set none of them and behaviour is exactly as before.

> **💡 When to Use Per-Operation Config**
>
- **Retain**: Use models with strong structured output (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude) for accurate fact extraction
- **Reflect**: Use faster/cheaper models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Groq) for reasoning and response generation
- **Mental model refresh**: On shared/local hardware, point it at a no-think or cheaper hosted model so the background job cannot destabilise interactive reflect
- **Recall**: Does not use LLM (pure retrieval), so no configuration needed
**Example: Separate Models for Retain and Reflect**

```bash
# Default LLM (used as fallback)
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxx
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o

# Use GPT-4o for retain (strong structured output)
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o

# Use faster/cheaper model for reflect
export HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_PROVIDER=groq
export HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_API_KEY=gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxx
export HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
```

**Example: Tuning Retry Behavior for Rate-Limited APIs**

```bash
# For Anthropic with tight rate limits (10k output tokens/minute)
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxx
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Reduce concurrent requests for retain to avoid rate limits
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT=3

# Fail faster with fewer retries
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MAX_RETRIES=3

# Or increase backoff times to wait out rate limit windows
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_INITIAL_BACKOFF=2.0  # Start at 2s instead of 1s
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MAX_BACKOFF=120.0    # Cap at 2min instead of 1min
```

> **📝 Per-operation concurrency composes with the global cap**
>
`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT`, `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT`,
`HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT`, and
`HINDSIGHT_API_MENTAL_MODEL_REFRESH_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT` add an extra cap that applies *on top of*
`HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT`. A retain call counts against both the retain cap and the
global cap; a reflect call without a per-op cap is bounded only by the global cap.

To reserve headroom for live chat/reflect on a rate-limited provider, cap retain and
consolidation below the global value — e.g. global=4, retain=1, consolidation=1 leaves
two slots that retain/consolidation cannot consume. The mental-model refresh cap covers
the background refresh, its dry run and its delta operations, and is separate from the
reflect cap — capping it is how you stop the background job from starving interactive
reflect on shared hardware.

Unlike the per-operation timeout and retry/backoff knobs, the `*_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT`
caps are process-global semaphores read from the environment once at startup. They are
server-level only (not overridable per tenant/bank) and a change requires a restart.
### Embeddings

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER` | Provider: `local`, `onnx`, `tei`, `openai`, `openai-codex`, `openrouter`, `requesty`, `cohere`, `google`, `zeroentropy`, `litellm`, or `litellm-sdk` | `local` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_MAX_INPUT_TOKENS` | Applies to **every** provider: truncate each text to this many tokens (counted with `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKENIZER_ENCODING`, approximate) before embedding, so oversized content is truncated instead of failing the embed call permanently. The budget covers the whole payload, including any client-side prefix an asymmetric model needs. The default matches the input limit of essentially every remote embedding model (OpenAI `text-embedding-3-*`, Bedrock Titan V2, Cohere v3, a stock llama.cpp context) — set it to your model's real limit if it differs, or to `0` to send text uncapped. **The cap is counted in Hindsight's tokens, not your provider's.** If your model uses a different tokenizer (for example `BAAI/bge-m3`, `nomic-embed-text`, or most open-source models behind TEI or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint), the same text can count up to ~2× more tokens on the provider's side, especially code, logs, or minified text. Text cut to exactly 8192 then still exceeds the model's limit, and the embed call fails with a 400. For these models, convert the limit: divide the model's real limit by how many of its tokens one Hindsight token becomes on your content, e.g. `4096` for an 8192-token model when embedding code. (Deprecated alias: `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LITELLM_SDK_MAX_INPUT_TOKENS`.) | `8192` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_QUERY_PREFIX` | Text prepended to every search before it is embedded. Set it when your endpoint serves an asymmetric model that expects a search instruction — e.g. `task: search result \| query: ` for `google/embeddinggemma-300m`, or `query: ` for E5. Applies to the providers that only accept plain text (`tei`, `openai`, `openai-codex`, `openrouter`, `requesty`, `litellm`, `litellm-sdk`); see the note below for the ones that don't need it. Trailing spaces are kept as written. | - (no prefix) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_PASSAGE_PREFIX` | Text prepended to every stored memory/document before it is embedded — e.g. `title: none \| text: ` for `google/embeddinggemma-300m`, or `passage: ` for E5. Same providers as above. Trailing spaces are kept as written. | - (no prefix) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LOCAL_MODEL` | Model for local provider. Models that ship their own search-text and stored-text instructions (e.g. the Qwen3-Embedding family) have them applied automatically — see the note below. | `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LOCAL_TRUST_REMOTE_CODE` | Allow loading models with custom code (security risk, disabled by default) | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LOCAL_FORCE_CPU` | Force CPU mode for local embeddings even when CUDA/XPU is available | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_ID` | Hugging Face model repo for the ONNX provider. Used for auto-download and as the tokenizer fallback. | `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_PATH` | Local path to the ONNX graph. When unset, Hindsight downloads `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_FILE` from `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_ID`. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_TOKENIZER_NAME_OR_PATH` | Hugging Face tokenizer repo or local tokenizer directory. Set this when using `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_PATH`. | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_ID` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_FILE` | ONNX file path inside the Hugging Face repo. Hindsight also downloads the conventional external-data sidecar with `_data` suffix when present. | `onnx/model.onnx` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_DIMENSIONS` | Expected embedding dimensions. Startup fails if the loaded model returns a different size. | Auto-detected |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MAX_TOKENS` | Max tokenizer length for ONNX embeddings. | `512` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_POOLING` | Pooling strategy for token embeddings: `mean` or `cls`. Ignored when the ONNX graph returns a pre-pooled 2-D embedding output. | `mean` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_NORMALIZE` | L2-normalize ONNX vectors before storage. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_QUERY_PREFIX` | Prefix applied to query/search text before ONNX embedding. Keep `query: ` for E5 models; set to empty for non-E5 models such as MiniLM or BGE. | `query: ` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_PASSAGE_PREFIX` | Prefix applied to stored memory/document text before ONNX embedding. Keep `passage: ` for E5 models; set to empty for non-E5 models such as MiniLM or BGE. | `passage: ` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_OUTPUT_NAME` | Optional ONNX output name to request when an exported graph exposes a pooled embedding output. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_BATCH_SIZE` | Texts per ONNX forward pass. The provider runs in-process, so this is what bounds the activation tensor (and therefore peak memory) when a caller embeds a large list — an import, for example. | `32` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_CPU_MEM_ARENA` | Enable ONNX Runtime's CPU memory arena. The arena caches freed blocks and never returns them, so RSS holds its high-water mark for the life of the process. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_TEI_URL` | TEI server URL | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_TEI_BATCH_SIZE` | Max texts per TEI `/embed` request, and the unit the client fans out over (see `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`). TEI's own `--max-client-batch-size` (32 by default) is a hard validation error rather than a soft cap, so raising this above the server's value fails the request instead of being clamped | `32` |

| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_OPENAI_BATCH_SIZE` | Max inputs per `embeddings.create` call for `openai`/`openrouter` providers — lower this when the upstream endpoint enforces stricter limits (e.g. DashScope caps at 10) | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_OPENAI_DIMENSIONS` | Optional requested output dimensions for OpenAI `text-embedding-3` models (e.g., `384` to match an existing pgvector schema) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` | Embedding requests a remote provider keeps in flight for one `encode()` call. This is what buys throughput from an embedding service: the same TEI server sustains ~903 texts/s at one in-flight request and ~2,080 at eight. Applies to every remote provider (`tei`, `openai`, `cohere`, `zeroentropy`, `litellm`, `litellm-sdk`, `google`, ...); the in-process `local`/`onnx` backends are unaffected. Lower it when the embedding service or your provider quota cannot take the parallelism | `8` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_MAX_RETRIES` | Retries after the first attempt when a remote embedding call fails transiently (5xx, timeout, connection error). `0` disables retrying. Applies to the `litellm`, `litellm-sdk`, `google` (Gemini API / Vertex AI), `cohere` and `zeroentropy` providers — none of which retry on their own — including Gemini `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` quota responses; 4xx auth/validation errors are never retried.

When set, the startup dimension probe is skipped, so the API boots even while the proxy is still starting.

Embedding provider selection, credentials, base URLs, model choices, dimensions, encoding format, batch sizes, and latency modes are static server-level settings. They are not hierarchical per-bank overrides. The ONNX settings above are also static, matching the existing `embeddings_local_*` settings.

> **📝 Models that treat searches and stored text differently**
>

Some embedding models are trained to see a short instruction in front of a search, and nothing (or a different instruction) in front of the text being stored. With the `local` provider, Hindsight applies whichever instructions the model itself ships with — you don't configure anything. The default `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` ships none, so nothing changes for existing deployments; `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-*` ships one for searches only, which is what makes those models retrieve accurately.

The rare case to watch for is a model that also instructs the **stored** side. Switching to one of those changes how new memories are indexed, so anything already stored was indexed differently and will compare poorly against it. Re-index the bank (export and re-import it) after adopting such a model. Search-side-only instructions, which covers every model listed above, need no re-indexing.

Most providers can't discover those instructions the way `local` does. A remote endpoint that takes plain text and returns a vector — `tei`, `litellm`, `litellm-sdk`, and anything behind an OpenAI-compatible `/embeddings` URL (`llama-server`, `infinity-emb`, vLLM, ...) — only ever receives the text, so you supply the instructions yourself with `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_QUERY_PREFIX` and `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_PASSAGE_PREFIX`. Leaving them unset sends the text unchanged, which is what the symmetric hosted models expect.

Two providers need nothing and ignore both settings: `local` (applies the model's own prompts) and `zeroentropy` (tells the API which side it is embedding). The `onnx` provider has its own pair, `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_QUERY_PREFIX` / `..._PASSAGE_PREFIX`, which default to the E5 instructions.

#### Local ONNX embeddings

The ONNX provider runs embedding models in-process with ONNX Runtime. Install the optional deps when building your own API environment:

```bash
pip install 'hindsight-api-slim[local-onnx]'
# or, in this repository:
uv sync --project hindsight-api-slim --extra local-onnx
```

You can either let Hindsight download the model from Hugging Face at startup by setting `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_ID`, or pre-download the ONNX graph and tokenizer files under the Hindsight repository root.

```bash
cd /path/to/hindsight
mkdir -p models

MODEL_ID=intfloat/multilingual-e5-small
MODEL_DIR=models/intfloat__multilingual-e5-small

uv run --project hindsight-api-slim --extra local-onnx python - <<'PY'
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

snapshot_download(
    repo_id=os.environ["MODEL_ID"],
    local_dir=os.environ["MODEL_DIR"],
    allow_patterns=[
        "onnx/model.onnx",
        "onnx/model.onnx_data",
        "*.json",
        "*.txt",
        "*.model",
    ],
)
PY
```

Then start Hindsight with paths relative to the repository root:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=onnx
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_PATH=./models/intfloat__multilingual-e5-small/onnx/model.onnx
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_TOKENIZER_NAME_OR_PATH=./models/intfloat__multilingual-e5-small
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_DIMENSIONS=384
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_QUERY_PREFIX="query: "
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_PASSAGE_PREFIX="passage: "
```

For Docker deployments, mount the same model directory and use container paths:

```yaml
services:
  hindsight:
    volumes:
      - ./models:/app/models:ro
    environment:
      HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER: onnx
      HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_PATH: /app/models/intfloat__multilingual-e5-small/onnx/model.onnx
      HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_TOKENIZER_NAME_OR_PATH: /app/models/intfloat__multilingual-e5-small
      HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_DIMENSIONS: "384"
      HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_QUERY_PREFIX: "query: "
      HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_PASSAGE_PREFIX: "passage: "
```

Model-specific examples:

```bash
# sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2: 384 dimensions, no E5 prefixes
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_ID=sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

```

> **⚠️ Warning**
>
Do not mix embeddings from different models in the same vector index. Switching from `local` to `onnx`, or changing ONNX models, requires re-embedding existing memories/documents even when the vector dimensions happen to match. For example, `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` and `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` both produce 384-dimensional vectors, but their embedding spaces are not semantically comparable.
> **⚠️ Warning**
>
The default ONNX query/document prefixes (`query: ` and `passage: `) are for E5 models. Clear both prefix variables for non-E5 models such as MiniLM or BGE, otherwise Hindsight will prepend E5-style text to models that were not trained with that format.
#### Common Pitfall: Provider-Specific Embedding Env Var Names

Embedding environment variables include a provider segment in the key name:

`HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_{PROVIDER}_{PARAMETER}`

For example, when `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=openai`:

| Wrong | Correct |
|---|---|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_BASE_URL` | `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_OPENAI_BASE_URL` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL` | `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_OPENAI_MODEL` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY` | `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_OPENAI_API_KEY` |

This differs from LLM variables, which follow `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_{PARAMETER}` without a provider segment.

> **⚠️ Warning**
>
If embedding keys are misnamed, Hindsight may fall back to default OpenAI embedding settings (for example, `text-embedding-3-small`) and fail with auth errors against the wrong endpoint.
#### DeepSeek and Embeddings

DeepSeek is supported as an **LLM** provider, but it does **not** expose an embeddings endpoint. If your LLM is DeepSeek, use a different embedding provider (for example `local`, `openai`, `cohere`, or `google`).

```bash
# Local (default) - uses SentenceTransformers

#### Embedding Dimensions

Hindsight automatically detects the embedding dimension from the model at startup and adjusts the database schema accordingly. The default model (`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`) produces 384-dimensional vectors, while OpenAI models produce 1536 or 3072 dimensions.

For `litellm-sdk`, if you set `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LITELLM_SDK_OUTPUT_DIMENSIONS`, startup uses that output size when the underlying provider supports LiteLLM's `dimensions` parameter (otherwise behavior is unchanged). The same dimension-change rules below apply.

For `zeroentropy`, zembed-1 supports `2560`, `1280`, `640`, `320`, `160`, `80`, and `40` dimensions. ZeroEntropy's API default is `2560`; Hindsight defaults to `1280` so the provider works with the default pgvector HNSW index. Use `2560` with a vector extension that supports higher-dimensional indexes, such as DiskANN/pgvectorscale or ScaNN.

> **⚠️ Dimension Changes**
>
Once memories are stored, you cannot change the embedding dimension without losing data. If you need to switch to a model with different dimensions:

1. **Empty database**: The schema is adjusted automatically on startup
2. **Existing data**: Either delete all memories first, or use a model with matching dimensions

Supported OpenAI embedding dimensions:
- `text-embedding-3-small`: 1536 dimensions
- `text-embedding-3-large`: 3072 dimensions
- `text-embedding-ada-002`: 1536 dimensions (legacy)

Google's `gemini-embedding-001` produces 3072 dimensions natively but supports configurable output dimensionality. Set `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_GEMINI_OUTPUT_DIMENSIONALITY` to control the output size (default: 768).

ZeroEntropy's `zembed-1` supports Matryoshka dimensions: `2560`, `1280`, `640`, `320`, `160`, `80`, and `40`. Hindsight defaults to `1280` for this provider.
### Reranker

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_PROVIDER` | Provider: `local`, `tei`, `cohere`, `openrouter`, `zeroentropy`, `siliconflow`, `typesafe`, `alibaba`, `google`, `flashrank`, `litellm`, `litellm-sdk`, `jina-mlx`, or `rrf` | `local` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_RETRIES` | Retries after the first attempt when a remote rerank call fails transiently (5xx, timeout, connection error, `429` quota). `0` disables retrying. Applies to every remote provider except `tei`, which has its own retry loop; the in-process providers (`local`, `flashrank`, `jina-mlx`, `rrf`) are unaffected. 4xx auth/validation errors are never retried. | `3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_INITIAL_BACKOFF` | Initial backoff in seconds between rerank retries (doubles per attempt, with jitter) | `0.5` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_BACKOFF` | Cap on the backoff between rerank retries, in seconds | `4.0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_RETRY_BUDGET` | Wall-clock ceiling, in seconds, on the time one rerank may spend retrying (failed attempts plus backoff).

> **📝 Apple Silicon: the local providers run on CPU**
>

PyTorch's MPS (Metal) backend is never used for the local embeddings or reranker
models. It caches a kernel and allocator pool per input tensor shape and never releases
them, so a variable-length workload grows without bound (idle instances reached ~20 GB),
and concurrent inference aborts the process with a Metal validation assertion. The
`HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LOCAL_ALLOW_MPS` and `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_LOCAL_ALLOW_MPS`
flags that used to opt in have been removed; setting them now logs a warning and does
nothing. For GPU reranking on Apple Silicon use `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_PROVIDER=jina-mlx`.
CUDA and Intel XPU are unaffected and still auto-select.

#### Reranker failover chain

Reranking is a refinement stage, but by default a reranker that is unreachable takes
recall down with it. Configure extra rerankers **by index** and Hindsight tries them
in order: if a member fails (timeout, connection error, HTTP error, or an unusable
response), the next one serves the request.

The unindexed `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_*` config is the **primary** (member 0). Extra
members are numbered from 1, and every setting of member `n` carries the same index —
`HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_<n>_<SETTING>` for any `<SETTING>` in the table above:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_<n>_PROVIDER` | Provider for fallback member `n` (`n` = 1, 2, ...). Presence of this var defines the member; indices must be contiguous from 1. Unset = no fallback (default). | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_<n>_<SETTING>` | Any other reranker setting, for member `n` — e.g. `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_1_TEI_URL`, `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_1_COHERE_API_KEY`, `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_1_TEI_HTTP_TIMEOUT`. | Same built-in default as the primary |

An indexed member is read **in isolation**: it inherits nothing from the primary and
nothing from the shared provider keys (`HINDSIGHT_API_COHERE_API_KEY` and friends), so
spell out every setting it needs with its own index. Unset settings fall back to the
same built-in defaults the primary uses. Chain-level settings
(`HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES`, `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_SEND_BANK_AS_HEADER`)
stay global and are not indexed.

```bash
# Primary: a self-hosted reranker that is not always up.
export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_PROVIDER=tei
export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_TEI_URL=http://workstation:8081

# Member 1: a hosted reranker to fall back on.
export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_1_PROVIDER=cohere
export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_1_COHERE_API_KEY=...

# Member 2: last resort — no reranking, keep the fusion order rather than fail.
export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_2_PROVIDER=rrf
```

Ending the chain with `rrf` makes recall **fail open**: results come back in the order
the retrieval stages produced, exactly as if no reranker were configured, instead of
the request failing. Without an `rrf` member (or with every member down) the error still
surfaces, which is the default behaviour.

Notes:

- Members are tried in order on every request; there is no circuit breaker, so a member
  that is down costs its own timeout on each request before the next one is tried. Keep
  the timeouts of an unreliable primary short (`HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_TEI_HTTP_TIMEOUT`
  and the per-provider `*_TIMEOUT` settings).
- A member that fails to initialize at startup is logged, not fatal — it is retried on
  the next request that reaches it.
- Scores are not comparable across providers (some return calibrated `[0, 1]` relevance,
  others logits), so a request served by a fallback member can score differently from one
  served by the primary. Failovers are logged at `WARNING`.
- The indexed members are credential fields — never returned by the bank-config API, and
  server-level only (not per-bank configurable).

> **💡 Sizing a TEI reranker**
>

TEI reserves one slot per text in a rerank request and rejects the request outright
once its pool is full, so start it with at least
`HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_TEI_MAX_CONCURRENT × HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_TEI_BATCH_SIZE`
slots — 1024 for the defaults above, versus TEI's own default of 512:

```bash
text-embeddings-router --max-concurrent-requests 2048 ...
```

Below that threshold, heavy recall traffic makes the reranker reject work it has the
capacity to do. Rejections are retried with backoff, so an undersized pool shows up as
slower recall rather than errors.

#### LiteLLM Proxy vs SDK

- **`litellm`**: Requires running a separate LiteLLM proxy server. Good for centralized configuration, rate limiting, and caching.
- **`litellm-sdk`**: Direct API access without proxy. Simpler setup, lower latency, fewer infrastructure components.

Both support the same providers:
- **Cohere** (`cohere/rerank-english-v3.0`, `cohere/rerank-multilingual-v3.0`)
- **DeepInfra** (`deepinfra/Qwen3-reranker-8B`, `deepinfra/bge-reranker-v2-m3`)
- **Together AI** (`together_ai/Salesforce/Llama-Rank-V1`)
- **HuggingFace** (`huggingface/BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3`)
- **Voyage AI** (`voyage/rerank-2`)
- **Jina AI** (`jina_ai/jina-reranker-v2`)
- **AWS Bedrock** (`bedrock/...`)

#### TypeSafe

TypeSafe is not a `/rerank` endpoint. It evaluates typed *questions* against a *state*,
and this provider asks two of them.

**Rank — one question for the whole pool.** A Choice returns a probability for every
option, summing to 1, so Hindsight makes the candidates the options and reads the
ranking straight off the answer: one call, however many candidates. Judged together the
model only has to say which candidate beats which, rather than pin each one to an
absolute scale in isolation — on a 200-question LoCoMo set that scored recall@1 0.94
against 0.87 for one call per candidate, at a thirtieth of the calls.

A Choice accepts at most 255 options, so a larger pool is ranked in rounds and the
winners are then ranked against each other. Probabilities are normalised within a
single call, so rounds cannot simply be concatenated.

**Cut — `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_TYPESAFE_PRUNE_CANDIDATES=true`.** A second question, a
Score over the ranked shortlist, asks how far down the list relevance extends; whatever
falls past that point is left out. Recall then returns the relevant candidates in order
and nothing else. No threshold is tuned — the model picks the depth.

A Score is used rather than adding a "none of these" option to the Choice because Score
levels are *ordered*, which is what a cut point needs. As a Choice option, "none of
these" is just another rival for the probability mass, and it wins outright on hard
queries: 35 of 200 questions came back completely empty, against none with the Score.

There is deliberately no "nothing is relevant" level, so at least one candidate always
survives. Recall runs on a pool retrieval already judged plausible, and one weak memory
the caller can dismiss beats silence.

The flag is off by default because it meaningfully shrinks what recall returns. Turn it
on when the consumer is an LLM prompt (reflect, for instance) and every irrelevant
memory is wasted context.

**Scores are positions, not confidences.** A Choice probability is a share of one pool:
0.7 means "the best of these", not "relevant", and two pools are not comparable. The
provider therefore hands back rank positions, and exactly `0.0` for anything past the
cut.

#### Jina MLX (Apple Silicon)

The `jina-mlx` provider uses [`jinaai/jina-reranker-v3-mlx`](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-reranker-v3-mlx), optimized for Apple Silicon. The model (~1.2 GB) is downloaded from HuggingFace Hub automatically on first startup and cached locally.

`mlx` is Apple's Metal framework, so the `local-ml` extra only installs it on Apple Silicon — its Linux build is CPU-only and slower than the `local` provider. Selecting `jina-mlx` elsewhere fails at startup unless you install `mlx`/`mlx-lm` yourself.

### Authentication

By default, Hindsight runs without authentication. For production deployments, enable API key authentication using the built-in tenant extension:

```bash
# Enable the built-in API key authentication
export HINDSIGHT_API_TENANT_EXTENSION=hindsight_api.extensions.builtin.tenant:ApiKeyTenantExtension
export HINDSIGHT_API_TENANT_API_KEY=your-secret-api-key
```

When enabled, all requests must include the API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-api-key" \
  http://localhost:8888/v1/default/banks
```

Requests without a valid API key receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TENANT_EXTENSION` | Dotted path to the loaded tenant extension. Set to `hindsight_api.extensions.builtin.tenant:ApiKeyTenantExtension` to require an API key on every request. | *(none; auth disabled)* |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TENANT_API_KEY` | Shared API key checked by the built-in API-key extension. Sent by clients as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. | *(none)* |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EXTENSION_PASSTHROUGH_HEADERS` | Comma-separated request headers copied into `RequestContext.extra_headers` for extensions to read, matched case-insensitively. Empty means extensions see only the `Authorization` header. | *(none)* |

If you are enabling Memory Defense, see `docs/developer/memory-defense/` for the policy schema, detector catalog, and audit trail.

#### Forwarding extra headers to extensions

A custom `TenantExtension` normally only sees the `Authorization` header, as `RequestContext.api_key`. That is not enough when the bearer token identifies the *proxy* rather than the caller — for example behind an authenticating gateway that presents one shared service identity to Hindsight, and carries the per-caller identity in a second header.

List those headers to have them forwarded:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_EXTENSION_PASSTHROUGH_HEADERS=x-user-assertion,x-request-origin
```

They arrive in `RequestContext.extra_headers`, keyed by lower-cased name, on both the HTTP and MCP transports, and thread through to `OperationValidatorExtension` hooks with the rest of the request context. Only listed headers that are actually present on the request appear; the setting is unset by default, so extensions receive no header data unless you opt in.

A listed header that arrives **more than once** is dropped (with a warning) rather than resolved to one of its values, so a duplicate can never silently override the value your proxy injected. Headers forwarded this way are only as trustworthy as the proxy in front of Hindsight: list a header only if that proxy sets it and strips any client-supplied copy. The setting is server-level and cannot be overridden per tenant or bank.

> **💡 Custom Authentication**
>
For advanced authentication (JWT, OAuth, multi-tenant schemas), implement a custom `TenantExtension`. See the [Extensions documentation](./extensions.md) for details.
### Server

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_HOST` | Bind address | `0.0.0.0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_PORT` | Server port | `8888` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_BASE_PATH` | Base path for API when behind reverse proxy (e.g., `/hindsight`) | `""` (root) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKERS` | Number of uvicorn worker processes | `1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ACCESS_LOG` | Enable uvicorn access log (`true`, `1`, `yes`, `on` to enable) | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DAEMON_LOG` | Where `--daemon` redirects the server's stdout and stderr. Set this per profile when several daemons run on one machine, so their output does not interleave into a single file. | `~/.hindsight/daemon.log` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FREE_THREADING` | What to do when running on a free-threaded (`python3.14t`) interpreter: `strict` refuses to start if the GIL is still enabled, `warn` logs and continues, `off` disables the check. Unset lets the interpreter decide — `strict` on a free-threaded build, `off` on a normal one. | interpreter-dependent |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOG_LEVEL` | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error` | `info` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOG_FORMAT` | Log format: `text` or `json` (structured logging for cloud platforms) | `text` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOG_JSON_FIELDS` | Comma-separated allowlist of JSON log fields to emit (e.g. `severity,message,tenant`). Available: `severity`, `message`, `timestamp`, `logger`, `tenant`, `exception`. Empty = all fields. | `""` (all) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_ENABLED` | Enable MCP server at `/mcp/{bank_id}/` | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_GZIP_MIN_SIZE` | Minimum response size (bytes) to gzip. Compressing a recall response costs ~5% of its CPU, so a CPU-bound (rather than bandwidth-bound) deployment can raise this past its typical response size. Negative disables compression entirely. | `1024` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOOP_LAG_REPORT_SECONDS` | Diagnostic: log event-loop lag percentiles (`[loop-lag]`) every N seconds (minimum 1), to tell a slow await from an oversubscribed loop. `0` disables the probe. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOOP_LAG_METRIC` | Record every event-loop lag sample in the `hindsight_event_loop_lag_seconds` histogram (sampled every 50 ms), independent of the log reports above. A loop that is busy but never blocked shows up here and nowhere else: the recall phase timers stay fast while requests wait for the loop. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_METRICS_WORKER_LABEL` | With `--workers N` every worker is its own process with its own metrics, but they share one port, so a scrape of `/metrics` reaches one worker at random: counters jump between processes (a rate over them reads every switch as a reset) and a saturated worker is invisible. When on, each worker publishes a snapshot of its metrics every 5 s and `/metrics` returns every live worker's series, each labelled `api_worker="<slot>"` (slot `0..N-1`). One port and one scrape target; the extra label is the only visible change. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKENIZER_ENCODING` | Vocabulary used for every token count and chunk boundary (recall budgets, chunk sizes, prompt fitting, embedding truncation). `o200k_base` matches current OpenAI models and counts non-Latin text far closer to what they actually charge; `cl100k_base` reproduces the counts Hindsight produced before this default changed. Server-level: token budgets are only comparable between banks if they are all counted the same way. Other bundled vocabulary: `o200k_harmony`. | `o200k_base` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MODEL_INIT_TIMEOUT` | Wall-clock cap (seconds) on startup model/connection initialization. If embeddings, the cross-encoder, or LLM verification block (e.g. an offline model download or an unreachable provider), the server fails fast with a clear error instead of hanging forever. Increase if a legitimate first-time model download needs more time. | `300` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_STARTUP_WAIT_SECONDS` | **Docker image only.** How long the container waits for the API to answer `/health` before it stops and restarts. Raising `HINDSIGHT_API_MODEL_INIT_TIMEOUT` above the default raises this wait too, so a slow first-time model download is not cut short; set this to override the wait on its own. | `300`, or `HINDSIGHT_API_MODEL_INIT_TIMEOUT` + 30s when that is longer |

### Egress proxy

Outbound calls (LLM providers and gateways, remote embeddings and rerankers, document
parsers, the Supabase tenant extension) follow the standard proxy environment variables —
`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`. There is no Hindsight-specific proxy setting: set
these on the process (pod env, systemd unit, shell) before it starts.

Three things to know:

- **The proxy URL itself must be `http://`.** On the API's own HTTP calls (embeddings,
  rerankers, parsers, gateways reached directly) an `https://` proxy URL is ignored with a
  warning, and `ALL_PROXY` / SOCKS is dropped. Provider SDKs that bring their own HTTP client
  (OpenAI, Anthropic) do read `ALL_PROXY`, so don't rely on it either way — set `HTTP_PROXY`
  and `HTTPS_PROXY`.
- **Put local endpoints in `NO_PROXY`.** Nothing is exempted automatically — not even
  `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. A deployment that sets `HTTP_PROXY` and also runs a local
  Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp or TEI must list those hosts in `NO_PROXY`, or their calls
  are sent to the proxy. This includes the llama.cpp server Hindsight spawns itself: the
  readiness probe is always direct, but the completions that follow go through the OpenAI
  SDK and will honour the proxy.
- **Credentials in `~/.netrc` are applied too**, to the destination host, not just the proxy.
  A netrc entry matching a provider host does not override the `Authorization` header
  Hindsight sends — the call fails outright with `Cannot combine AUTHORIZATION header with
  AUTH argument`. Remove the entry, or point `NETRC` at a file without it.

Webhook delivery is the one caller that ignores all of this on purpose: its SSRF guard
validates the address it resolved, and a proxy would contact one that was never checked.

### Retrieval

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_GRAPH_RETRIEVER` | Graph retrieval algorithm | `link_expansion` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LINK_EXPANSION_PER_ENTITY_LIMIT` | Max target units expanded per entity in `link_expansion` graph retrieval (LATERAL fanout cap per entity; bounds high-fanout entities). | `200` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LINK_EXPANSION_TIMEOUT` | Timeout (seconds) for the per-entity graph expansion query in `link_expansion` retrieval. | `10` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Max concurrent recall operations per worker (backpressure) | `32` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_CONNECTION_BUDGET` | Max concurrent DB connections per recall operation | `4` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ADMISSION_RECALL_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` | Concurrent recalls admitted per worker before requests queue. `0` derives it from the CPU budget this process has (cgroup quota) divided by `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKERS`; a negative value disables the lane. A latency target, not a capacity limit: throughput is unchanged either way, but too low throttles I/O-bound work and too high rebuilds the queue. | `0` (derived) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ADMISSION_RECALL_MAX_WAIT_MS` | How long a recall may queue for a slot before being refused with 503 + `Retry-After`. A queued request whose client disconnects releases its place immediately. Absorbs bursts; lower it if load is persistently over capacity, where a long queue just delays the same refusals. | `30000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ADMISSION_REFLECT_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` | As above, for reflect. | `0` (derived) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ADMISSION_REFLECT_MAX_WAIT_MS` | As above, for reflect. | `5000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ADMISSION_RETAIN_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` | As above, for retain. Only bites on the synchronous path; an async retain returns as soon as the operation is queued. | `0` (derived) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ADMISSION_RETAIN_MAX_WAIT_MS` | As above, for retain. | `2000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_MAX_QUERY_TOKENS` | Maximum token length of a recall query. API requests exceeding this limit are rejected with HTTP 400; recalls that Hindsight runs internally (consolidation, reflect, MCP) truncate the query to the limit instead of failing. `0` disables the limit. | `500` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_QUERY_ANALYZER_LANGUAGES` | Restrict the locales `dateparser` considers when extracting temporal constraints from a recall query, as a comma-separated list of language codes (e.g. `en` or `en,zh`). Empty keeps full auto-detection across all supported locales. Restricting is significantly faster (auto-detection dominates recall's CPU cost) and avoids locale misdetection on a known-language corpus, but explicit dates written in an unlisted locale will then misparse rather than yield no constraint — only set this when you know which languages your queries use. Does not affect Chinese, which is handled before `dateparser` runs. | _(empty)_ |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES` | Max candidates to rerank per recall (RRF pre-filters the rest) | `300` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES_LOW` | Override the reranker candidate cap for `budget=low` recalls (the cross-encoder is the dominant cost of a large recall, so a lower cap trades some depth for latency). `0` falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES_MID` | Override the reranker candidate cap for `budget=mid` recalls. `0` falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES_HIGH` | Override the reranker candidate cap for `budget=high` recalls. `0` falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_SEMANTIC_MIN_SIMILARITY` | Minimum cosine similarity a candidate must reach to be returned by the semantic retrieval strategy. Must be between `0` and `1`. | `0.3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_GRAPH_SEED_MIN_SIMILARITY` | Minimum cosine similarity for a memory to seed graph retrieval. This is independent from the main semantic retrieval threshold. Must be between `0` and `1`. | `0.3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TEMPORAL_SEMANTIC_MIN_SIMILARITY` | Minimum cosine similarity for temporal retrieval entry points and spread neighbors. This is independent from the main semantic retrieval threshold. Must be between `0` and `1`. | `0.1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_SEMANTIC_LINK_MIN_SIMILARITY` | Minimum cosine similarity for creating semantic links during normal retain, streaming retain, and graph-maintenance relinking. This directly controls semantic graph density. Must be between `0` and `1`. | `0.7` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_BM25_MIN_SCORE` | Minimum BM25 score a row must exceed to enter fusion. Gates out zero-score, non-matching rows on backends (notably `vchord`) whose operator ranks every document instead of pre-filtering to query-term matches. `0` keeps only genuine term matches; raise it to require stronger matches. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_MAX_CANDIDATES_PER_SOURCE` | Cap on candidates each retrieval source (semantic, BM25, graph, temporal) contributes to RRF, applied before the global reranker cap. Prevents one over-expanding backend from filling the reranker budget on its own. `0` disables the cap. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_STRATEGY_BOOSTS` | Prioritise one or more retrieval sources over the others on recall, as a comma-separated `strategy:level` list (e.g. `graph:high` to strongly favour graph hits, or `graph:high,bm25:low`). Strategies: `semantic`, `bm25`, `graph`, `temporal`. Levels: `low` (gentle — mainly protects the source's candidates from being dropped before reranking), `medium` (moderate preference), `high` (strong — the source takes the large majority of the reranker's candidate budget and outranks most other matches, only a strong direct match still wins). The pre-cap boost works in rank space: a boosted candidate at rank `r` outranks another arm's candidate at rank `s` when `r < divisor * s` (divisors: `low` 2, `medium` 4, `high` 8). Displacement is therefore proportional to rank — the top-ranked hits of the other arms always survive the cut — and does not change with the size of your bank's merged candidate pool. The boost is applied in two places: before the reranker cap (so favoured candidates survive the `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES` budget) and after reranking (to nudge them up the final order); a named level is used because those two stages live on different score scales. Only the strategies you list are boosted — any you omit keep their normal weight (no implicit boost). A strategy written without a level (`graph` or `graph:`) defaults to `medium`. Empty disables the feature. | _(empty)_ |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_FUNCTION` | Shape of the recency boost applied during reranking — how a memory's age is turned into a small freshness adjustment to its final rank. `linear` (default) decays in a straight line from full freshness (today) to a floor reached at `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_LINEAR_WINDOW_DAYS`. `exponential` decays by half-life: a memory is treated as neutral (no boost or penalty) at `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_HALFLIFE_DAYS`, younger memories are boosted and older ones penalised, with a smooth fade rather than a hard cutoff. `none` disables recency entirely (age never affects ranking). | `linear` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_LINEAR_WINDOW_DAYS` | For the `linear` decay function: the number of days over which a memory fades from full freshness to the minimum. Only used when `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_FUNCTION=linear`. | `365` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_HALFLIFE_DAYS` | For the `exponential` decay function: the age (in days) at which a memory is considered neutral — younger memories get a recency boost, older ones a penalty. Smaller values favour very recent memories more aggressively. Only used when `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_FUNCTION=exponential`. | `90` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_MENTAL_MODEL_HISTORY` | Track history of content changes to each mental model (previous content + timestamp), stored one row per change in the `mental_model_history` table. Set to `false` to disable entirely — no history rows are written, reducing storage if audit trails are not needed. **This is how you turn the feature off** (not a zero cap). | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MENTAL_MODEL_MIN_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | Minimum seconds between two *automatic* refreshes of the same mental model — the after-consolidation trigger and the cron schedule. A trigger that fires sooner is not dropped: its refresh is queued and parked until the window closes, and every further trigger in the meantime folds into that one queued refresh, so a burst of small retains costs one refresh instead of one per retain. Raise it when a bank ingests continuously and its models do not need to be current to the minute — the parked refresh still sees everything that accumulated while it waited. Explicit refreshes (API, MCP, control plane) ignore the floor and run immediately, and additionally release a parked refresh they fold into. `0` = no floor, every trigger refreshes at once. Hierarchical — overridable per bank via the [config API](#hierarchical-configuration), and per model via `trigger.min_refresh_interval_seconds` (which wins, including an explicit `0` to exempt one hot model from a bank-wide floor). | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_KNOWLEDGE_PAGE_DEFAULT_TRIGGER` | Default refresh settings for newly created knowledge pages, as a JSON object merged over the built-in default (`{"mode": "delta", "fact_types": ["observation"], "exclude_mental_models": true, "refresh_after_consolidation": true}`). Set only the fields you want to change — e.g. `{"refresh_cron": "0 * * * *"}` makes new pages refresh hourly instead of after every consolidation. A trigger sent when creating the page still wins; existing pages are not changed. Configurable per bank. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MENTAL_MODEL_HISTORY_MAX_ENTRIES` | Max history rows kept per mental model. On each refresh the previous version is inserted into the `mental_model_history` table and the oldest rows beyond this cap are deleted, so per-model history can't grow without bound. `0` or a negative value **removes the cap** (history then grows with every refresh — unbounded); to turn history off entirely set `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_MENTAL_MODEL_HISTORY=false` instead. | `50` |

The five embedding-dependent gates—main semantic retrieval, graph seeds, temporal retrieval, semantic-link
construction, and observation deduplication—serve different precision/recall tradeoffs and are intentionally
configured independently. Their defaults preserve the behavior calibrated for `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`.
Changing embedding models can shift cosine-similarity distributions even when both models return normalized
vectors, so recalibrate all five values against their respective tasks before production use.

Changes to `HINDSIGHT_API_SEMANTIC_LINK_MIN_SIMILARITY` are not retroactive. The new value applies when new
semantic links are created during retain, streaming retain, or graph maintenance; maintenance does not remove
existing links below a raised threshold, and nodes that already have enough semantic links are not recomputed
when the threshold is lowered. To make an existing semantic graph fully conform to a new threshold, rebuild the
graph or re-ingest the source data into a new memory bank.

#### Graph Retrieval Algorithm

- **`link_expansion`** (default): Fast graph expansion from semantic seeds via entity co-occurrence, semantic kNN, and causal links. Target latency under 100ms.

#### Recall budget mapping

The recall request takes a `budget` parameter (`low` / `mid` / `high`, default `mid`) that maps to an integer `thinking_budget` used by every retrieval method (semantic, BM25, graph, temporal). These knobs control that mapping. They are hierarchical — overridable per bank via the [config API](#hierarchical-configuration).

Two functions are available:

- **`fixed`** (default — preserves legacy behavior): `thinking_budget = recall_budget_fixed_<level>` (independent of `max_tokens`).
- **`adaptive`**: `thinking_budget = round(max_tokens * recall_budget_adaptive_<level>)`, clamped to `[recall_budget_min, recall_budget_max]`. Useful when callers vary `max_tokens` and you want retrieval breadth to scale with the requested output size.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_FUNCTION` | Mapping function: `fixed` or `adaptive`. | `fixed` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_FIXED_LOW` | Items per retrieval method per fact type when `budget=low` and function is `fixed`. | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_FIXED_MID` | Items per retrieval method per fact type when `budget=mid` and function is `fixed`. | `300` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_FIXED_HIGH` | Items per retrieval method per fact type when `budget=high` and function is `fixed`. | `1000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_ADAPTIVE_LOW` | Ratio of request `max_tokens` used when `budget=low` and function is `adaptive`. | `0.025` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_ADAPTIVE_MID` | Ratio of request `max_tokens` used when `budget=mid` and function is `adaptive`. | `0.075` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_ADAPTIVE_HIGH` | Ratio of request `max_tokens` used when `budget=high` and function is `adaptive`. | `0.25` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_MIN` | Floor for the adaptive function (after clamping). | `20` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_MAX` | Ceiling for the adaptive function (after clamping). | `2000` |

#### Recall pipeline stages

Recall runs four retrieval arms (semantic, BM25, graph, temporal) and then reranks the
fused candidates with a cross-encoder. Each stage costs latency, and a bank whose content
has no relational or temporal structure pays for arms it cannot use — for example a bank
ingested with `retain_extraction_mode: chunks` and used as plain retrieval.

These switch the individual stages off. All are hierarchical — overridable per bank via the
[config API](#hierarchical-configuration) — so one bank can run lean without changing how the
rest of the deployment recalls. Semantic always runs; it is the baseline retrieval.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_TEXT_SEARCH` | Run the keyword (BM25) retrieval arm. `false` leaves **pure vector search** — the arm is left out of the query entirely rather than filtered to nothing, so its SQL, its query tokenization and its `pg_stats` term-selection lookup are all skipped. Also drops the keyword arm from knowledge-page search. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_TEMPORAL_RETRIEVAL` | Run the temporal retrieval arm. `false` also skips the date-aware query analysis that feeds it — without a detected constraint there is nothing to filter on. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_GRAPH_RETRIEVAL` | Run the entity/link graph traversal arm. `false` skips those queries and returns no graph results. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_RERANKING` | Rerank fused candidates with the cross-encoder. `false` returns the RRF-fused ordering directly — faster, but less precise. | `true` |

Turning all four off reduces recall to a single vector query, which is the
lowest-latency configuration there is.

Disabling text search leaves the write path alone: `search_vector` and its index are
still maintained, so a bank can be switched back without a reindex. The
[text-search backend](#text-search-extension) it would have used is simply unread.

##### Pairing with the retain side: plain-retrieval ("RAG") banks

These recall toggles only remove work from the *read* path. If a bank is being used as
plain retrieval, the ingestion path should be configured to match — otherwise it still
pays for LLM work whose output recall no longer uses:

- **`retain_extraction_mode: chunks`** skips LLM fact extraction entirely and stores each
  chunk as-is. This returns before any LLM queue or lock is acquired, so it removes the
  LLM call from retain rather than just shortening it — normally the dominant cost of
  ingestion.
- **`enable_observations: false`** skips consolidation, the other background LLM workload.

Configured together, the bank behaves like a conventional vector store: chunks in, hybrid
search out, no LLM on either path. Set both sides in one call:

```bash
curl -X PUT "$HINDSIGHT_API_URL/v1/default/banks/plain-retrieval-bank" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HINDSIGHT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "retain_extraction_mode": "chunks",
    "enable_observations": false,
    "enable_temporal_retrieval": false,
    "enable_graph_retrieval": false,
    "enable_reranking": false
  }'
```

The trade-off is the point of the product: no extracted facts, entities, or links means no
graph or temporal structure to retrieve, and no mental models to reflect over. Use it for
banks that are genuinely plain retrieval — or to benchmark Hindsight against a baseline
vector store on equal terms — not as a general latency fix.

### Retain

Controls the retain (memory ingestion) pipeline.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` | Max completion tokens for fact extraction LLM calls | `64000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CHUNK_SIZE` | Max characters per chunk for fact extraction. Larger chunks extract fewer LLM calls but may lose context. | `3000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_STRUCTURED_CHUNK_SIZE` | Max characters for a single JSONL line or conversation turn to keep whole. Unset uses `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CHUNK_SIZE`. Must be a positive integer when set. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_ATTACHMENT_MAX_SIZE_MB` | Max decoded size of a single attachment sent as inline retain content. Above every mainstream provider's own per-file ceiling, so the provider's limit binds first for legitimate content while an abusive upload is refused at the ingress. | `20` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_ATTACHMENT_MAX_COUNT` | Max inline attachments in one retain item. Split larger documents across several items. | `50` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MAX_ATTACHMENTS_PER_CHUNK` | Max attachments in one extraction chunk. `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CHUNK_SIZE` budgets **text only** — a placeholder costs the ~22 characters it occupies and nothing more — so this is what bounds attachments, matching a provider's per-request limit. Lower it for a model with a smaller context. Configurable per bank. | `8` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE` | Fact extraction mode: `concise`, `verbose`, `verbatim`, `chunks`, or `custom` | `concise` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MISSION` | What this bank should pay attention to during extraction. Steers the LLM without replacing the extraction rules — works alongside any extraction mode. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS` | Full prompt override for fact extraction (only used when mode is `custom`). Replaces built-in extraction rules entirely. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACT_CAUSAL_LINKS` | Extract causal relationships between facts | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_OPTIONAL_FACT_DIMENSIONS` | Let a fact leave `when`/`where`/`who`/`why` empty instead of writing `"N/A"`. The four keys stay required in the schema; their values become `string \| null` and the prompt stops naming a placeholder. Turn it on for a small self-hosted model under `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA`, where "every property is required" means a fact with no date of its own must still emit *some* string — and the nearest plausible one is a date the text stated about something else. Off by default because it is not neutral on a capable model: with `why` droppable, "the user asked me to refactor X" tends to come back as its own `world` fact instead of riding along as the agent fact's rationale. Server-level, not per-bank. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_ENABLED` | Use LLM Batch API for fact extraction (50% cost savings, only with async operations) | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Max concurrent retain DB phases (HNSW reads + writes). Limits I/O contention during high-concurrency ingestion. | `4` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_SUBBATCH_CONCURRENCY` | Sub-batches of one document processed at a time. Most of a sub-batch is a store round-trip, so overlapping a few hides that wait. `1` keeps the splitter one slice ahead of the work, which bounds how much of a large document is resident. | `1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_WALL_TIMEOUT` | Wall-clock ceiling in seconds for one retain task in the worker. A retain that blocks indefinitely (lock contention, an unreachable LLM endpoint) is cancelled and marked `failed` instead of holding its worker slot until the process restarts, so it can be retried. Set well above your slowest healthy retain; `0` disables. | `3600` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_TOKENS` | Max characters per sub-batch for async retain auto-splitting | `10000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE` | Max chunks per streaming batch when retain ingests long documents. Each chunk produces roughly 17 facts, so the default 100 chunks ≈ 1700 facts per batch. Lower to cap memory/LLM pressure on large documents; raise for smaller chunks. Configurable per bank. | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MEMORY_BUDGET_MB` | Megabytes of extracted-but-unwritten state one retain operation may hold. `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE` bounds how many chunks are in flight, but not what they weigh — a chunk carries however many facts the extractor found in it — so this is the ceiling to size a worker against: peak per retain is roughly this figure whatever the document. Budget for `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS` concurrent retains. Over budget, extraction waits for the write path to catch up rather than growing. `0` disables it and restores the chunk-count-only bound. | `128` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_ENTITY_LOOKUP` | How retain finds *candidate* existing entities for an extracted name: `trigram` probes the pg_trgm index for similar names, `full` loads every entity in the bank and keeps the ones whose name is an exact or substring match. Both then run the same scoring pass (see [How entity resolution decides](#how-entity-resolution-decides)) — so this is not only a performance choice, it changes which names can merge at all. | `trigram` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_ENTITY_RESOLUTION_BATCH_SIZE` | Max unique entity names per fuzzy candidate lookup query (`trigram` on PG, `oracle_fuzzy` on Oracle). Bounds query size so very wide retain batches don't time out a single `unnest(...)` join on banks with many entities. | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_ENTITY_RESOLUTION_MAX_CANDIDATES` | Max candidates scored per entity mention. The fuzzy lookup keeps only this many best matches per name (ranked by trigram / Jaro-Winkler similarity) before the scoring pass. On banks holding thousands of near-identical names an uncapped candidate set turns one retain into minutes of CPU, which stalls the worker's health checks; matches ranked below the first ~100 never win anyway. Raise only if entities that should merge are being duplicated. | `200` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_DEFAULT_STRATEGY` | Default retain strategy name. When set, all retain calls without an explicit `strategy` parameter use this strategy. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | How often a retain waits between status checks against the **LLM provider's** Batch API while a submitted batch job runs. This is not a worker or ingestion knob — it does not control how often Hindsight picks up pending retains (see [`HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`](#distributed-workers) for that) and only applies when the provider's batch mode is in use. Setting it to `0` does not disable anything: it removes the wait entirely and polls the provider's status endpoint in a tight loop. | `60` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_STORE_DOCUMENT_TEXT` | Persist the raw source text alongside extracted memories. Set to `false` to skip storing it (`documents.original_text` NULL, `chunks.chunk_text` empty). Hierarchical — overridable per bank via the [config API](#hierarchical-configuration), so a data-minimizing bank can keep only derived facts while others retain the raw source. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FAIL_ON_EXTRACTION_ERRORS` | When `true`, a retain operation that accumulated any fact-extraction errors is marked `failed` (with an error message including the count) instead of `completed`, so silently-dropped facts surface as a hard failure. Default preserves existing behavior. Static, server-level. | `false` |

> **Batch-capable providers.** `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_ENABLED=true` only works with a retain LLM provider that implements a batch API: `openai`, `groq`, `gemini`, and `fireworks`. Batch always requires async retain (`async=true`); a sync retain with batch enabled errors. Other providers fail fast at startup.
>
> **Gemini** uses the [Gemini Batch API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/batch-api) (flat 50% input + output discount, 24h SLA — typically minutes). It needs no extra settings beyond `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_ENABLED=true` and an API-key `gemini` provider; Vertex AI (`vertexai`) is not batch-capable.

A retain item's `content` can be a plain string, as it always could, or an ordered
list of text, image and file blocks so an attachment sits where it actually appears:

```json
{
  "content": [
    {"type": "text",  "text": "To reset the VPN, click the button shown:"},
    {"type": "image", "source": {"type": "base64", "media_type": "image/png", "data": "..."}},
    {"type": "text",  "text": "...then reconnect."},
    {"type": "file",  "source": {"type": "base64", "media_type": "application/pdf", "data": "..."},
                      "filename": "escalation-policy.pdf"}
  ]
}
```

The point is *position*. Extraction runs the interleaved text and attachments
through a vision model, so the model reads a screenshot beside the sentence that
introduces it, rather than being handed a caption you produced beforehand. That is
the same bargain the rest of Hindsight offers for text: hand it the raw content
and trust the extractor.

`image` and `file` are separate types because the providers separate them —
Anthropic has distinct image and document blocks, OpenAI has `image_url` and file
parts — so carrying your own distinction through means the conversion never has to
guess from the media type alone.

This is distinct from [`POST /files/retain`](#file-processing), which converts a
whole file to markdown as its **own** document — still the right tool for scanned
PDFs and office documents when you want them parsed rather than looked at, but it
separates the content from the prose around it.

**Accepted types.** Any well-formed `type/subtype` is accepted. There is no
allowlist: whether the model can read a format is the model's answer to give, and
a provider that rejects one fails the retain with its own error, which is more
informative than a guess made at the ingress. Bytes are served back under the
Content-Type the caller declared.

> **⚠️ Warning**
>
Because the declared type is served verbatim, a bank writer who retains active
content (an SVG or an HTML file) can have it execute in the dataplane's origin
when it is fetched. Treat write access to a bank as equivalent to being able to
host content on that origin.
What happens to the bytes:

- They are hashed (sha256) and stored **content-addressed** under the document
  that carries them, so the same bytes always have the same id, an attachment
  repeated within one document is stored once, and re-retaining an unchanged
  document is a no-op. Two *different* documents carrying the same attachment
  hold a copy each — dedup across documents is deliberately given up, so that
  deleting a document never has to ask whether another one still needs the bytes.
- Storage goes through the same backend as uploaded files — `native`
  (PostgreSQL), `s3`, `gcs`, `azure`. See [File storage](#file-storage).
- The document's stored text keeps a placeholder (`⟦hs-att:...⟧`) where the
  attachment sat, so chunking, idempotency, `update_mode=append` and
  re-extraction behave exactly as they do for text.
- Which attachments a document carries is derived from that text on every write,
  and each `attachments` row names its owning document. So deleting a document —
  or re-retaining it without the attachment — reclaims exactly its own, the same
  way on every backend, including a bank whose documents live in a memories store.
- Every read surface returns the attachments alongside the text —
  `chunks[].attachments` and each memory's `attachments` on recall, plus
  get-document, get-chunk, get-memory and list-memories — each with a
  bank-authorized `url` serving the original bytes.

Extracted **facts** never carry the placeholder: a fact reads `[image:
image/png]` where the attachment was, and the machine-readable handle travels
beside it in `attachments`. A content hash is not knowledge.

A **memory's** `attachments` are the ones that fact was actually drawn from, not
every attachment in its chunk. They are stored on the memory itself
(`memory_units.attachment_ids`), like its tags, so they travel with the memory
rather than living in a separate edge table. Extraction runs one call per chunk, and a chunk
holding a screenshot also holds the prose around it, so the chunk's attachments
would otherwise be shown against every fact the call produced — the architecture
diagram offered as the evidence for the paragraph about paging policy. The
extractor is asked which attachments each fact came from, and a fact stated in
the surrounding text has no `attachments` at all. That emptiness is the feature:
an attachment shown beside a memory means the model looked at it to produce that
memory.

A **chunk's** `attachments` stay exactly what they were — everything the chunk
references — because that is a question about the chunk, not about a fact.

Two things will refuse the retain outright, both with `422`, rather than dropping
attachments silently:

- The retain LLM is not vision-capable, or Hindsight cannot tell that it is. See
  [`HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_VISION`](#llm-provider).
- `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_ENABLED=true`. The batch path builds provider
  request bodies directly and never sees the interleaved content.

#### Fireworks batch inference

Fireworks AI's batch API is **not** OpenAI `/v1/batches`-compatible — it is a proprietary, account-scoped dataset/job workflow on a separate control-plane host (`https://api.fireworks.ai`), distinct from the OpenAI-compatible inference host (`https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1`). Hindsight adapts it transparently, so enabling batch is the same as any other provider plus one required setting: your Fireworks **account id**. (This is separate from the existing LiteLLM `fireworks_ai/...` online path, which is unaffected.)

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` | Fireworks account id. **Required** for `fireworks` batch retain — the control-plane endpoints are `/v1/accounts/{account_id}/...`. Static, server-level. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FIREWORKS_BATCH_BASE_URL` | Fireworks batch control-plane host. | `https://api.fireworks.ai` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FIREWORKS_BATCH_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS` | Max time to wait for a batch job before surfacing a failure. Guards against the Fireworks gotcha where a non-batch-eligible model leaves the job `PENDING` forever. | `86400` (24h) |

```bash
# Fireworks batch retain (50% cost savings, async only)
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_PROVIDER=fireworks
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_API_KEY=fw_xxxxxxxxxxxx
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MODEL=accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-8b-instruct
export HINDSIGHT_API_FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_ENABLED=true
```

> **Entity labels** (`entity_labels`) and **free-form entity extraction** (`entities_allow_free_form`) are configured per bank via the [bank config API](api/memory-banks.md#retain-configuration), not as global environment variables — each bank can have its own controlled vocabulary. See [Entity Labels](retain.md#entity-labels) for details.

#### How entity resolution decides

Resolving an extracted name against the entities already in a bank happens in **two
stages, and each stage uses a different measure of similarity**. That distinction matters
before you tune any of the thresholds above: the number that is easiest to compute by
hand is not the number that decides the match.

**Stage 1 — which existing entities are considered.** With `trigram` (the default),
Postgres returns entities whose lowercased canonical name is trigram-similar to the
extracted name, gated by
[`HINDSIGHT_API_ENTITY_TRGM_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`](#database-connection-pool) — **`0.15`**,
which is deliberately looser than pg_trgm's own `0.3` default. At most
`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_ENTITY_RESOLUTION_MAX_CANDIDATES` survive, ranked by that
similarity. With `full`, candidates are instead the entities whose name is an exact or
substring match. Label entities never enter this stage; they resolve by exact match only.

**Stage 2 — whether one of them is reused.** Each candidate is scored, and the best one
is reused if it clears **`0.6`**. Otherwise a new entity is created.

| Signal | Weight | What it measures |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Name similarity | up to **0.5** | A character-sequence ratio between the two lowercased names (Python's `difflib.SequenceMatcher`) — **not** the trigram similarity from stage 1 |
| Co-occurring entities | up to **0.3** | How many of the *other* entities extracted from the same fact this candidate already co-occurs with, each weighted by how selective it is |
| Temporal proximity | up to **0.2** | How close the fact's date is to the candidate's `last_seen`, decaying linearly to zero at 7 days |

Before any of that is counted, the candidate must reach
`HINDSIGHT_API_ENTITY_MERGE_MIN_SIMILARITY` (**`0.3`**) in trigram similarity. That floor
exists because the two stages measure different things and can disagree, most sharply on
short names: the sequence ratio rewards any shared run of characters, so `Tigran` and `Iran`
score `0.80` on it — higher than `Alice`/`Alice Chen` (`0.67`), a merge the resolver exists
to make — while trigram ranks them correctly at `0.20` and `0.55`. Without the floor, the
remaining signals are worth `0.5` of the `0.6` needed, so a name that merely resembled an
existing entity could be merged onto it by the bank's history alone.

Two further checks run before the score. A candidate must **agree word by word**: every word of
the shorter name has to find a counterpart in the longer one (an equal word, an abbreviation of
one, or a near-miss spelling). Whole-name similarity otherwise lets a long shared word drown out
a completely different short one — `John Smith` and `Jane Smith` are `0.47` by trigram and `0.80`
by sequence ratio, so two people sharing a surname would merge. Single-word names are exempt,
since with one word the floor above already is the word-level check. And in the other direction,
a candidate whose trigram set is *identical* to the name's is reused outright, whatever the other
signals say: pg_trgm builds trigrams per word, so identical sets mean the two forms differ only in
case, punctuation or decoration (`Wren 🎵` and `Wren`, `GPT-4` and `GPT 4`).

The co-occurrence weighting matters for the same reason. An entity such as `user` co-occurs
with nearly every fact in a mature bank, so sharing it says almost nothing; each shared
entity is discounted by how many distinct entities it co-occurs with, and a partner seen
alongside a hundred others is worth a tenth of one seen alongside a single other.

So there are three thresholds, and they answer different questions:

| Threshold | Default | Question |
|---|---|---|
| `ENTITY_TRGM_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` | `0.15` | Which existing entities are even looked at? |
| `ENTITY_MERGE_MIN_SIMILARITY` | `0.3` | Which of them may be merged onto? |
| `ENTITY_INTRABATCH_MERGE_SIMILARITY` | `0.5` | Which brand-new names in one retain are folded together? |

**If unrelated entities are merging,** raise `HINDSIGHT_API_ENTITY_MERGE_MIN_SIMILARITY`.
Genuine surface variants of one name usually sit between `0.4` and `0.7`, so there is room
above the default. For names that must never be fuzzy-matched at all, model them as
[entity labels](retain.md#entity-labels), or pass them yourself with
[`resolve_entities: false`](api/retain.md#resolve_entities).

**If variants that should merge are staying separate,** lower
`HINDSIGHT_API_ENTITY_MERGE_MIN_SIMILARITY` — short names are the usual reason, since
trigram similarity on them is unavoidably low. If lowering it changes nothing, the candidate
is not reaching stage 2 at all: lower `HINDSIGHT_API_ENTITY_TRGM_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` too,
and check that `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_ENTITY_RESOLUTION_MAX_CANDIDATES` is not truncating the
right candidate away on a bank with many similar names.

#### Skip storing raw document text

By default Hindsight keeps a verbatim copy of everything you retain so you can later read the source, re-process a document, or export it. For deployments that only want to keep the extracted memories (facts, entities, mental models) and not the source text, set:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_STORE_DOCUMENT_TEXT=false
```

When disabled, the full retain pipeline still runs — chunking, fact extraction, embedding, and entity linking are unchanged, so **memory quality and recall are not affected** (recall reads from the extracted memories, never from the raw text). The difference is purely what gets persisted:

- `documents.original_text` is stored as `NULL` instead of the raw payload.
- The raw chunk text is dropped (stored as empty), while the chunk's content hash is still kept so incremental re-retain of the same document continues to deduplicate correctly.

**`update_mode="append"` is rejected when text storage is disabled.** Append rebuilds a document by reading back its previously stored text and adding to it. With nothing stored, appending would silently drop the prior content, so an append retain returns an error instead. Use `update_mode="replace"` (the default).

**Features that degrade when text storage is disabled** (because they read the source text back):

- **Document export** carries no source text; re-importing such a bank cannot re-run extraction from the original payload.
- **Reading a document's source** (the get-document, list-chunks, and get-chunk endpoints, including their MCP equivalents) returns empty content.
- **Recall with `include_chunks=true`** returns empty `chunk_text` — the facts themselves are unaffected, but the surrounding source-chunk context is no longer available.
- **Reflect** no longer offers the `expand` tool (which fetches a memory's source chunk/document), and its `recall` step stops attaching source chunks, since there is no stored text to return. Reflection over the extracted memories is otherwise unaffected.
- **Reprocessing a document** from its stored text is a no-op (there is nothing to reprocess).

This is a static, server-level setting and cannot be overridden per bank.

#### Customizing retain: when to use what

There are five levels of customization for the retain pipeline. Start with the simplest that covers your needs:

| Goal | Use |
|------|-----|
| Steer what topics to focus on or deprioritize | `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MISSION` |
| Extract more detail per fact | `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=verbose` |
| Store chunks as-is, LLM extracts metadata | `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=verbatim` |
| Store chunks as-is, zero LLM cost | `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=chunks` |
| Completely replace the extraction rules | `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=custom` + `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS` |

**`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MISSION` — steer extraction without replacing it (recommended starting point)**

Tell the bank what to pay attention to during extraction, in plain language. The mission is injected into the extraction prompt alongside the built-in rules — it narrows focus without replacing the underlying logic. Works with any extraction mode (`concise`, `verbose`, `verbatim`, `custom`). Ignored in `chunks` mode.

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MISSION="Focus on technical decisions, architecture choices, and team member expertise. Deprioritize social or personal information."
```

**`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=verbose` — more detail per fact**

Use when you need richer facts with full context, relationships, and verbosity. Slower and uses more tokens than `concise`.

**`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=verbatim` — store chunks as-is**

Each chunk is stored as a single memory unit with its original text preserved exactly — no summarization or rewriting. The LLM still runs to extract entities, temporal information, and location so the chunk is fully indexed and retrievable. Useful for RAG-style indexing, document ingestion pipelines, or benchmarks where you want the original text in memory rather than LLM-generated summaries.

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=verbatim
```

**`retain_strategies` / `retain_default_strategy` — per-call extraction strategy**

Named strategies let you ingest different content types into the same bank using different extraction settings. A strategy is a set of hierarchical field overrides applied on top of the resolved bank config.

Any field in the hierarchical config can be overridden per strategy, including `retain_extraction_mode`, `retain_chunk_size`, `retain_structured_chunk_size`, `entity_labels`, `entities_allow_free_form`, `retain_mission`, etc.

Configure strategies via the bank config API:

```json
{
  "retain_default_strategy": "conversations",
  "retain_strategies": {
    "conversations": {
      "retain_extraction_mode": "concise",
      "retain_chunk_size": 3000,
      "retain_structured_chunk_size": 12000
    },
    "documents": {
      "retain_extraction_mode": "chunks",
      "retain_chunk_size": 800,
      "entity_labels": null,
      "entities_allow_free_form": false
    }
  }
}
```

Then specify the strategy at retain time:

```python
# Uses default strategy ("conversations")
client.retain_batch(bank_id, items=[{"content": "Alice joined the team today"}])

# Explicitly use document strategy
client.retain_batch(bank_id, items=[{"content": "...document text...", "strategy": "documents"}])
```

If no `strategy` is specified in a retain call, `retain_default_strategy` is used. If neither is set, the bank/global config applies directly.

**`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=chunks` — zero LLM cost**

Each chunk is stored as-is with no LLM call whatsoever. No entity extraction, no temporal indexing — only embeddings are generated for semantic search. User-provided entities passed via `RetainContent.entities` are the sole source of entity data. Use when ingestion speed and cost matter more than structured metadata.

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=chunks
```

**`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=custom` + `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS` — full control**

Replaces the built-in selectivity rules entirely. The structural parts of the prompt (output format, temporal handling, coreference resolution) remain intact — only the extraction guidelines are replaced.

Use this when `retain_mission` isn't sufficient and you need strict inclusion/exclusion logic.

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=custom
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS="ONLY extract facts that are:
✅ Technical decisions and their rationale
✅ Architecture patterns and design choices
✅ Performance metrics and benchmarks

DO NOT extract:
❌ Greetings or social conversation
❌ Process chatter (\"let me check\", \"one moment\")
❌ Anything that would not be useful in 6 months"
```

### File Processing

Configuration for the file upload and conversion pipeline (used by `POST /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/files/retain`).

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_FILE_UPLOAD_API` | Enable the file upload API endpoint | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_DOCUMENT_EXPORT_API` | Enable the [document export](./api/memory-banks.mdx#document-export--import-superseded) endpoint (`GET /document-transfer`) | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_DOCUMENT_IMPORT_API` | Enable the [document import](./api/memory-banks.mdx#document-export--import-superseded) endpoint (`POST /document-transfer`) | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER` | Server-side default parser or fallback chain (comma-separated, e.g. `iris,markitdown`) | `markitdown` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_ALLOWLIST` | Comma-separated list of parsers clients are allowed to request. If not set, all registered parsers are allowed. | — |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_CONVERSION_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` | Max files per upload request | `10` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_CONVERSION_MAX_BATCH_SIZE_MB` | Max total upload size per request (MB) | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_DELETE_AFTER_RETAIN` | Delete stored files after memory extraction completes | `true` |

#### Parser selection

Clients can override the server default by passing `parser` in the request body of `POST /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/files/retain`. Both the server default and the per-request field accept a single parser name or an ordered **fallback chain** — each parser is tried in sequence until one succeeds.

```bash
# Server default: try iris first, fall back to markitdown if iris fails
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER=iris,markitdown

# Restrict what clients may request (optional — defaults to all registered parsers)
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_ALLOWLIST=markitdown,iris
```

```json
// Per-request override (in the JSON body of the file retain endpoint)
{
  "parser": "iris",
  "files_metadata": [
    { "document_id": "report" },
    { "document_id": "fallback_doc", "parser": ["iris", "markitdown"] }
  ]
}
```

Clients that request a parser not in the allowlist receive HTTP 400.

#### Parser: markitdown (default)

Local file-to-markdown conversion using [Microsoft's markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown). No external service is required by default.

**Supported formats:** PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX, PPT, XLSX, XLS, images (JPG, PNG — requires optional OCR for text extraction), audio (MP3, WAV — transcription), HTML, TXT, MD, CSV.

For image workloads, MarkItDown can optionally use an OpenAI-compatible OCR/vision endpoint. This is disabled by default. Without it, image uploads fail with an actionable configuration error instead of low-level parser output. When enabled, configure the MarkItDown OCR API key, base URL, and model explicitly; they do not inherit from `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_*` because MarkItDown uses the OpenAI SDK directly. The selected endpoint must implement OpenAI Chat Completions and the selected model must support image input.

This OCR path uses MarkItDown's image converter hook. It applies to image inputs such as JPG and PNG (and image handling inside converters that consume MarkItDown's `llm_client`), but it does not rasterize scanned PDF pages into images. Scanned PDFs with no text layer may still extract poorly through the default PDF converter. For scanned PDFs or complex document layouts, use an OCR-capable document parser such as `iris` or `llama_parse`, or configure a parser fallback chain like `llama_parse,markitdown`.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_ENABLED` | Enable MarkItDown image OCR through an OpenAI-compatible OCR/vision endpoint | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_API_KEY` | API key for MarkItDown OCR; required when OCR is enabled | — |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions base URL for MarkItDown OCR; required when OCR is enabled | — |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_MODEL` | OCR/vision model with image-input support; required when OCR is enabled | — |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_PROMPT` | OCR prompt passed to MarkItDown's image converter | Built-in OCR prompt |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_DEFAULT_HEADERS` | Optional JSON dict passed as `default_headers` to the OCR OpenAI SDK client (proxies / request-tracing middleware) | `null` |

```bash
# Configure a dedicated OpenAI-compatible OCR/vision endpoint for MarkItDown OCR
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER=markitdown
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_ENABLED=true
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_API_KEY=your-vision-api-key
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_BASE_URL=https://vision.example/v1
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_MODEL=ocr-or-vision-model
# Optional custom headers for proxies / request tracing
# export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_DEFAULT_HEADERS='{"X-Component-Id":"hindsight-ocr"}'
```

#### Parser: iris

Cloud-based extraction via [Vectorize Iris](https://docs.vectorize.io/build-deploy/extract-information/understanding-iris/). Higher quality extraction for complex documents, powered by a remote AI service.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_IRIS_TOKEN` | Vectorize API token | — |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_IRIS_ORG_ID` | Vectorize organization ID | — |

**Supported formats:** PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX, PPT, XLSX, XLS, images (JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WEBP), HTML, TXT, MD, CSV.

```bash
# Use iris as the only parser
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER=iris
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_IRIS_TOKEN=your-vectorize-token
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_IRIS_ORG_ID=your-org-id

# Or: try iris first, fall back to markitdown if iris fails or rejects the file type
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER=iris,markitdown
```

#### Parser: llama_parse

Cloud-based extraction via [LlamaParse](https://docs.cloud.llamaindex.ai/llamaparse) (LlamaIndex). Strong extraction for complex layouts — tables, charts, multi-column PDFs.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_LLAMA_PARSE_API_KEY` | LlamaCloud API key (typically starts with `llx-`) | — |

**Supported formats:** PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, HTML, EPUB, RTF, TXT, and many more — see the [LlamaParse docs](https://docs.cloud.llamaindex.ai/llamaparse/features/supported_document_types) for the full list.

# Use llama_parse as the only parser
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER=llama_parse
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_LLAMA_PARSE_API_KEY=llx-your-api-key

export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER=llama_parse,markitdown
```

```bash
# Increase batch limits for large file imports
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_CONVERSION_MAX_BATCH_SIZE=20
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_CONVERSION_MAX_BATCH_SIZE_MB=500

# Keep files after processing (useful for debugging or re-processing)
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_DELETE_AFTER_RETAIN=false
```

### File Storage

Files uploaded via the file retain API are stored in an object storage backend before conversion. Choose the backend that fits your infrastructure.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_TYPE` | Storage backend: `native`, `s3`, `gcs`, or `azure` | `native` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_EXTENSION` | `module.path:ClassName` naming your own `FileStorage` implementation, used instead of the built-in backends. Every other `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_*` variable is passed to it as a lowercased config dict. Implement `delete_prefix` too, or deleting a bank leaves that bank's stored files in your backend. | unset |

#### Native (PostgreSQL)

Files are stored as `BYTEA` in the `file_storage` table. No additional infrastructure required. Suitable for development and small deployments.

```bash
# Native storage is the default — no additional configuration needed
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_TYPE=native
```

#### S3 / S3-Compatible

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET` | S3 bucket name | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_REGION` | AWS region | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT` | Custom endpoint URL (for S3-compatible stores like MinIO, Cloudflare R2, Tigris) | AWS default |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS access key ID | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret access key | - |

For S3-compatible providers that don't expose AWS-style regions (MinIO, Cloudflare R2, Tigris), set `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_REGION=auto`. The value is required for SigV4 request signing but is ignored by the service.

```bash
# AWS S3
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_TYPE=s3
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET=my-hindsight-files
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_REGION=us-east-1

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_GCS_BUCKET` | GCS bucket name | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` | Path to service account JSON key file | ADC if not set |

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_TYPE=gcs
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_GCS_BUCKET=my-hindsight-files
# Optional: use service account key file (otherwise falls back to ADC)

#### Azure Blob Storage

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_AZURE_CONTAINER` | Azure container name | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME` | Azure storage account name | - |

#### Storage Backend Comparison

| Backend | Best For | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `native` | Development, small deployments | No extra infrastructure, stored in PostgreSQL |
| `s3` | Production, AWS deployments | Works with any S3-compatible store |
| `gcs` | Production, GCP deployments | Supports ADC for keyless auth |
| `azure` | Production, Azure deployments | Uses account key auth |

> **💡 Production Recommendation**
>
For production deployments, use `s3`, `gcs`, or `azure` to avoid storing large binary files in your PostgreSQL database. Set `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_DELETE_AFTER_RETAIN=true` (the default) to delete files after memory extraction, which minimizes storage costs.
### Observations (Experimental) {#observations}

Observations are deduplicated, evidence-grounded knowledge consolidated from multiple facts. Each observation tracks its supporting memories and a proof count, and is refined — not overwritten — when new evidence arrives.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_OBSERVATIONS` | Enable observation consolidation | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_AUTO_CONSOLIDATION` | Automatically trigger consolidation after retain, delete, and update operations. When `false`, consolidation only runs when explicitly triggered via the [consolidate endpoint](api/operations.md#consolidation). Configurable per bank. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_WALL_TIMEOUT` | Ceiling in seconds on how long one consolidation task in the worker may run **without making progress**. Every batch that commits restarts the clock, so a large backlog is never cut short — only a genuinely stalled job is. A stalled consolidation is cancelled and marked `failed` (which the API will retry, unlike `processing`, and which lets the reconcile sweep re-schedule the bank) instead of holding its reserved worker slot until the process restarts. `0` disables. | `7200` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | Interval for the background sweep that re-schedules consolidation for banks with unconsolidated facts but no consolidation in progress — recovering facts left unscheduled when a consolidation operation failed terminally (e.g. the LLM provider was unavailable). Only applies to banks with auto-consolidation enabled. `0` disables the sweep — but see the note below: that stops work being *scheduled*, not work already queued from *running*. | `300` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MENTAL_MODEL_REFRESH_TICK_SECONDS` | How often the background loop checks for cron-scheduled mental models that are due for a refresh. This is only the *check* cadence; the actual schedule is the per-model `trigger.refresh_cron` expression set on the mental model. A due model is refreshed only when it is stale (new memories in its scope since the last refresh). It also sets a **floor on cron granularity** — at the default, a `* * * * *` schedule fires every 5 minutes, not every minute; lower it if you need finer schedules, at the cost of a more frequent cross-tenant scan (see [Background Maintenance](#background-maintenance)). `0` disables the sweep — but see the note below: that stops work being *scheduled*, not work already queued from *running*. | `300` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_OBSERVATION_HISTORY` | Track history of changes to each observation (previous text/tags/dates + timestamp), stored one row per change in the `observation_history` table. Set to `false` to disable entirely — no history rows are written. **This is how you turn the feature off** (not a zero cap). | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATION_HISTORY_MAX_ENTRIES` | Max history rows kept per observation. On each update the previous version is inserted into the `observation_history` table and the oldest rows beyond this cap are deleted, so an often-reinforced observation's history can't grow without bound. `0` or a negative value **removes the cap** (unbounded); to turn history off entirely set `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_OBSERVATION_HISTORY=false` instead. | `50` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | Outer retry attempts for the consolidation LLM batch call, used only for connection and rate-limit style failures (with backoff between attempts). Malformed or schema-invalid output is not re-sent — the batch fails immediately and is split into smaller batches instead. A provider quota exhaustion is not retried here at all: the whole job is rescheduled for when quota reopens. Each retried attempt uses the inner retry budget (`HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_MAX_RETRIES`), so worst-case API calls per batch = `MAX_ATTEMPTS × (LLM_MAX_RETRIES + 1)`. | `3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_BATCH_SIZE` | Memories to load per batch (internal optimization) | `50` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_MAX_MEMORIES_PER_ROUND` | Maximum memories processed per consolidation round. When the limit is reached, the job yields its worker slot and re-queues itself so other banks get fair scheduling. Mental model refreshes only run on the final round. `0` = unlimited. Configurable per bank. | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_MAX_TOKENS` | Max tokens for recall when finding related observations during consolidation | `1024` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` | Max completion tokens requested for each consolidation LLM batch call. Unset by default, so each provider keeps its implicit output budget. Set this when a provider applies a low hidden cap (e.g. Bedrock imported models) that truncates consolidation output. | `unset` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_BATCH_SIZE` | Number of facts sent to the LLM in a single consolidation call. Higher values reduce LLM calls and improve throughput at the cost of larger prompts. Set to `1` to disable batching. Configurable per bank. | `8` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_DEDUP_THRESHOLD` | Cosine similarity at/above which a newly-created or freshly-updated observation is reconciled against an existing near-identical one via a focused 1-by-1 LLM "merge or keep" call (the model reads both texts, so a number/negation/entity difference is respected). Catches near-duplicate observations that weaker consolidation models emit even when shown the twin, as well as duplicates that arise when an update rewrites an observation into a near-twin of another. Set to `1.0` to disable. Postgres only — consolidation skips reconciliation on Oracle regardless of this value. | `0.97` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_PARALLELISM` | Maximum number of tag groups consolidated concurrently within one consolidation op. Each group acquires per-scope locks before processing, so groups whose write scopes overlap (e.g. under `per_tag` / `all_combinations` / explicit-list `observation_scopes`) automatically serialise on the overlapping scopes — actual concurrency may be lower than this cap when scopes contend. Set to `1` for fully sequential behaviour. Higher values raise peak LLM QPS and connection-pool usage during consolidation proportionally — tune down if your LLM provider rate-limits tightly or your DB pool is small. Configurable per bank. | `4` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_RECALL_BUDGET` | Budget level for the recall pass inside consolidation (`low`, `mid`, `high`). Lower budgets fetch fewer candidate rows, reducing peak memory usage on large banks. | `low` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_SOURCE_FACTS_MAX_TOKENS` | Total token budget for source facts included with observations in the consolidation prompt. `-1` = unlimited. Configurable per bank. | `4096` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_SOURCE_FACTS_MAX_TOKENS_PER_OBSERVATION` | Per-observation token cap for source facts in the consolidation prompt. Each observation independently gets at most this many tokens of source facts. `-1` = unlimited. Configurable per bank. | `256` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION` | What this bank should synthesise into durable observations. Replaces the built-in consolidation rules — leave unset to use the server default. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MAX_OBSERVATIONS_PER_SCOPE` | Maximum number of observations allowed per tag scope. When the limit is reached, consolidation will only update or delete existing observations — no new ones are created. Applies per tag scope (e.g., per-tag when using `per_tag` observation scopes). Observations with no tags are not subject to this limit. `-1` = unlimited. Configurable per bank. | `-1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATION_SCOPE_LIMITS` | **Deprecated** — use `CONSOLIDATION_STRATEGIES`, which carries the mission too; this is still honoured, but consulted only afterwards. Per-scope overrides of `MAX_OBSERVATIONS_PER_SCOPE`, as a JSON array of `{"scope": [tag-globs], "limit": int}` rules. Each `scope` is a list of [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) globs; a consolidation scope matches under *exact cover* — every tag must be matched by a glob and every glob must match a tag, so `["shared"]` matches the scope `{shared}` but not `{run_1, shared}`. The first matching rule wins; scopes that match no rule fall back to `MAX_OBSERVATIONS_PER_SCOPE`. Example: `[{"scope": ["shared"], "limit": -1}, {"scope": ["run_*", "shared"], "limit": 50}]` keeps the `{shared}` scope unlimited while capping each `{run_*, shared}` scope at 50. Configurable per bank. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_STRATEGIES` | Per-scope consolidation settings, as a JSON array of `{"scopes": [{"tags": [tag-globs], "tags_match": "all" \| "exact"}, ...], "observations_mission": str, "max_observations_per_scope": int, "consolidation_source_facts_max_tokens": int, "consolidation_source_facts_max_tokens_per_observation": int}` strategies. Each strategy lists the scopes it claims — a scope is a list of [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) globs, and a consolidation pass is claimed when *any* of the strategy's patterns matches its tags. Each pattern's `tags_match` sets how: `"all"` (default) — the scope has every tag in the pattern, other tags allowed; `"exact"` — exactly those tags and no others. Every setting is optional. **Exactly one strategy applies to a scope: the first in the list that claims it.** Whatever that strategy leaves unset — and every scope no strategy claims — uses the bank-wide `OBSERVATIONS_MISSION`, `MAX_OBSERVATIONS_PER_SCOPE`, `CONSOLIDATION_SOURCE_FACTS_MAX_TOKENS` and `CONSOLIDATION_SOURCE_FACTS_MAX_TOKENS_PER_OBSERVATION`. This supersedes `OBSERVATION_SCOPE_LIMITS` and is what lets a single bank be federated across user / team / company tag scopes: each scope is consolidated by its own LLM call, so each can follow a different brief. Example: `[{"scopes": [{"tags": ["company:*"]}], "observations_mission": "Record only generalized, industry-level trends. Never name a specific company, deal size, or funding stage."}]` keeps per-user scopes detailed while the company-wide scope stays generic. Configurable per bank. | - |

> **📝 Disabling a sweep stops scheduling, not execution**
>

Background work runs in two independent stages, and the interval knobs above only
govern the first:

1. **Scheduling** — the maintenance loop periodically sweeps for work that is due
   (consolidation to reconcile, mental models to refresh) and enqueues an
   operation for it. `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_SECONDS=0`
   and `HINDSIGHT_API_MENTAL_MODEL_REFRESH_TICK_SECONDS=0` switch these sweeps
   off, so no *new* work is enqueued.

2. **Execution** — the worker poller claims and runs whatever is already pending,
   on its own cadence
   ([`HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`](#distributed-workers), default
   500ms). It is not affected by the interval knobs at all, and it picks up
   operations that were queued before the sweeps were disabled — including ones
   recovered from a previous run after a restart.

So zeroing the intervals quiesces a *quiet* deployment, but on one with a backlog
the worker keeps consolidating and refreshing regardless. To stop the process
executing background work entirely, disable the worker itself:

```bash
HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_ENABLED=false
```

This matters when isolating a workload for benchmarking or debugging: with only
the intervals zeroed, a queued consolidation or retain can still run alongside
whatever you are measuring and be attributed to it.

#### Customizing observations: when to use what

| Goal | Use |
|------|-----|
| Default behavior: durable specific facts, no ephemeral state | Leave unset |
| Change what observations *are* for this bank (different shape, different purpose) | `HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION` |

**`HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION` — redefine what this bank synthesises**

By default, observations are durable, specific beliefs consolidated from memories — the kind of knowledge that stays true over time (preferences, skills, relationships, recurring patterns). Each one is grounded in the source memories that support it. Ephemeral state is filtered out. Contradictions are tracked with temporal markers rather than overwriting the prior belief.

Set `HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION` to replace this definition entirely. Write a plain-language description of what observations should be for your use case. The LLM will use this instead of the default rules when deciding what to create or update. Leave it unset to keep the server default.

> **💡 When to use observations_mission**
>
Use it when the default durable-knowledge behavior doesn't match your use case. Common scenarios:
- You want **broader event summaries** rather than isolated facts
- You want observations **grouped by time period** (weekly, monthly)
- You want a **different granularity** (one observation per project rather than per fact)
- You have a **domain-specific** notion of what's worth remembering
**Example: Weekly event summaries**

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION="Observations are broad summaries of project events grouped by week. Each observation should capture what happened, what was decided, and what was blocked — not individual facts. Merge related events into cohesive weekly narratives."
```

**Example: Person-centric knowledge**

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION="Observations are durable facts about specific named people: their preferences, skills, relationships, and behavioral patterns. Only create observations for facts that are stable over time and tied to a named individual."
```

**Example: Support ticket patterns**

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION="Observations are recurring patterns in customer support interactions: common failure modes, frequently requested features, and pain points that appear across multiple tickets."
```

### Reflect

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_MAX_ITERATIONS` | Max tool call iterations before forcing a response | `10` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | Max accumulated context tokens in the reflect loop before forcing final synthesis. Prevents `context_length_exceeded` errors on large banks. Lower this if your LLM has a context window smaller than 128K. | `100000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_WALL_TIMEOUT` | Wall-clock timeout in seconds for the entire reflect operation. If exceeded, the request returns HTTP 504. | `300` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_MISSION` | Global reflect mission (identity and reasoning framing). Overridden per bank via config API. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_SOURCE_FACTS_MAX_TOKENS` | Token budget for source facts in `search_observations` during reflect. `-1` disables source facts (default), `0` enables with no limit, `>0` enables with a token budget. Hierarchical — can be overridden per bank via config API. | `-1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_DEFAULT_OPTIONS` | Default reflect options as a JSON object, applied whenever a reflect request — or a mental model's trigger — leaves the option unset. `reflect_search_observations_max_tokens` sets the budget for the `search_observations` tool (a smaller budget drops the lowest-ranked observations and shrinks the reflect context); `reflect_search_observations_include_entities` turns off the resolved entity names attached to each observation, which can be more than half the tool payload. E.g. `{"reflect_search_observations_max_tokens": 3000, "reflect_search_observations_include_entities": false}`. Hierarchical — can be overridden per bank via config API. | - |

#### Internal recall (used by reflect and mental model refresh)

These knobs control the recall tool the reflect agent runs (including when refreshing a mental model). They set what a `recall` tool call gets when the model does not ask for a specific budget; an explicit ask from the model wins, within the bounds reflect applies to any model-supplied token argument. They are hierarchical — overridable per bank via the config API, and individually overridable per mental model via the `trigger.include_chunks`, `trigger.recall_max_tokens`, and `trigger.recall_chunks_max_tokens` fields.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_INCLUDE_CHUNKS` | Whether the internal recall returns raw chunk text alongside facts. Set `false` to skip chunks and save prompt budget. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_MAX_TOKENS` | Token budget for facts returned by the internal recall. | `2048` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_CHUNKS_MAX_TOKENS` | Token budget for raw chunks returned by the internal recall. | `1000` |

#### Disposition

Disposition traits control how the bank reasons during reflect operations. Each trait is on a scale of 1–5. These are hierarchical — they can be overridden per bank via the [config API](#hierarchical-configuration).

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DISPOSITION_SKEPTICISM` | How skeptical vs trusting (1=trusting, 5=skeptical) | `3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DISPOSITION_LITERALISM` | How literally to interpret information (1=flexible, 5=literal) | `3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DISPOSITION_EMPATHY` | How much to consider emotional context (1=detached, 5=empathetic) | `3` |

### MCP Server

Configuration for MCP server endpoints.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_ENABLED` | Enable MCP server at `/mcp/{bank_id}/` | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS` | Comma-separated allowlist of MCP tools to expose globally (empty = all tools) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_STATELESS` | Use stateless HTTP transport (POST-only). When `false`, enables stateful mode with GET/SSE support for server-initiated messages | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | Bearer token for MCP authentication (optional) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_LOCAL_BANK_ID` | Memory bank ID for local MCP | `mcp` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS` | Additional instructions appended to retain/recall tool descriptions | - |

**Tool Access Control:**

`HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS` restricts which MCP tools are registered at the server level. This is useful for read-only deployments or limiting surface area:

```bash
# Expose only recall (read-only deployment)
export HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS=recall

# Expose recall and reflect only
export HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS=recall,reflect
```

Available tool names: `retain`, `recall`, `reflect`, `list_banks`, `create_bank`, `list_mental_models`, `get_mental_model`, `create_mental_model`, `update_mental_model`, `delete_mental_model`, `refresh_mental_model`, `list_directives`, `create_directive`, `delete_directive`, `list_memories`, `get_memory`, `list_documents`, `get_document`, `delete_document`, `list_operations`, `get_operation`, `cancel_operation`, `list_tags`, `get_bank`, `get_bank_stats`, `update_bank`, `delete_bank`, `clear_memories`, `get_knowledge_base_tree`, `search_knowledge_base`, `get_knowledge_page`, `create_knowledge_folder`, `create_knowledge_page`, `update_knowledge_node`, `delete_knowledge_node`.

This can also be overridden per bank via the [config API](#hierarchical-configuration):

```bash
# Restrict a specific bank to read-only MCP access
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8888/v1/default/banks/config-demo-bank/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"updates": {"mcp_enabled_tools": ["recall"]}}'
```

When a bank-level `mcp_enabled_tools` is set, tools not in the list return a clear error when invoked (they still appear in the tools list for MCP protocol compatibility).

**MCP Authentication:**

By default, the MCP endpoint is open. For production deployments, set `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` to require Bearer token authentication:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-token
```

Clients must then include the token in the `Authorization` header. See [MCP Server documentation](./mcp-server.md#authentication) for details.

**Local MCP instructions:**

```bash
# Example: instruct MCP to also store assistant actions
export HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS="Also store every action you take, including tool calls and decisions made."
```

### Distributed Workers

Configuration for background task processing. By default, the API processes tasks internally. For high-throughput deployments, run dedicated workers. See [Services - Worker Service](./services#worker-service) for details.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_ENABLED` | Enable the internal worker in the API process. Set to `false` to stop this process claiming and running queued background operations (consolidation, retain, mental model refresh) — this, not the maintenance interval knobs, is what quiesces execution. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_ID` | Unique worker identifier | hostname |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | Database polling interval in milliseconds | `500` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_MAX_RETRIES` | Max retries before marking task failed | `3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_TASK_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS` | Seconds between retries on transient task failure | `60` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_BACKPRESSURE_DEFER_SECONDS` | How long a task the store shed for backpressure is held before it is retried. Long enough that the backlog has a real chance to drain — retrying into a still-full store just sheds again — and short enough that a cleared backlog is not left waiting. Deferrals do not count against `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_MAX_RETRIES`. | `120` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_HTTP_PORT` | HTTP port for worker metrics/health (worker CLI only) | `8889` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_MAX_SLOTS` | Maximum concurrent tasks per worker (total across all operation types) | `10` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OPERATION_RETENTION_DAYS` | Static server-wide retention window for completed, failed, and cancelled operation rows, including their task payload and result metadata. `0` (the default) keeps them indefinitely; set a positive number of days to enable automatic pruning. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OPERATION_CLEANUP_BATCH_SIZE` | Maximum expired terminal operation rows deleted per tenant schema during each cleanup cycle. Together with the cleanup interval this sets the drain rate for a backlog. Must be a positive integer. | `1000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OPERATION_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | How often the cleanup cycle runs. Each cycle costs one cross-tenant discovery round-trip, so the interval is the main lever on that cost for deployments with many tenants (see [Background Maintenance](#background-maintenance)). `0` disables the job. | `900` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_CONSOLIDATION_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for consolidation within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS` — a floor that guarantees capacity, **not** a per-type cap (bank-serialization preserved). See the note below. | `2` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_CONSOLIDATION_BANK_PRIORITY` | Per-bank priority for consolidation scheduling (see note below) | _(unset)_ |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_RETAIN_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for retain within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_FILE_CONVERT_RETAIN_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for file_convert_retain within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_REFRESH_MENTAL_MODEL_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for refresh_mental_model within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_GRAPH_MAINTENANCE_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for graph_maintenance within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_IMPORT_DOCUMENTS_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for import_documents within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_EXPORT_BANK_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for export_bank within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_IMPORT_BANK_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for import_bank within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_<TYPE>_MAX_SLOTS` | **Deprecated** alias for `..._RESERVED_SLOTS`, where `<TYPE>` is one of `CONSOLIDATION`, `RETAIN`, `FILE_CONVERT_RETAIN`, `REFRESH_MENTAL_MODEL`, `GRAPH_MAINTENANCE`, `IMPORT_DOCUMENTS`. The name is misleading — it always set the reservation floor, never a ceiling. Still honored but logs a warning; will be removed in a future release. Setting both it and `..._RESERVED_SLOTS` is an error. | _(unset)_ |

Terminal operations use one coherent retention window for the entire row. Hindsight does not scrub the task payload when an operation finishes: failed and cancelled operations need it for retry, while `include_payload=true` on completed operations is an explicit debugging surface. Keeping payload, result metadata, progress, and status together also avoids partial operation histories. Once a terminal row's `updated_at` is older than the configured window, the background maintenance loop prunes it in bounded per-schema batches, alongside the other scheduled sweeps. PostgreSQL only — the maintenance loop does not run on Oracle. Pending and processing rows are never pruned by this cleanup.

> **📝 Worker slot reservations are a floor, not a cap**
>
`..._RESERVED_SLOTS` reserves a guaranteed *minimum* number of slots (a floor) for an operation type within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`, so a saturated pool can't starve it. It is **not** a per-type maximum. The sum of all reservations must not exceed `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS` (startup raises `ValueError` otherwise). Remaining capacity (`WORKER_MAX_SLOTS - sum of reservations`) forms a **shared pool** usable by any type on a first-come basis, and a type whose reservation is full **overflows into the shared pool** — so a type's real ceiling is `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`, regardless of its reservation.

Example: `MAX_SLOTS=10`, `CONSOLIDATION_RESERVED_SLOTS=2`, `RETAIN_RESERVED_SLOTS=3`, `REFRESH_MENTAL_MODEL_RESERVED_SLOTS=2` → shared pool = `10 - (2+3+2) = 3`.

With the defaults (`MAX_SLOTS=10`, `CONSOLIDATION_RESERVED_SLOTS=2`, all other reservations `0`), 2 slots are always reserved for consolidation and the remaining 8 form the shared pool; consolidation may still overflow the shared pool up to 10. Set `CONSOLIDATION_RESERVED_SLOTS=0` to release its reserved capacity into the shared pool. Consolidation's bank-serialization constraint (no two consolidation tasks for the same bank concurrently) is preserved regardless of which pool claims the slot.

The legacy `..._MAX_SLOTS` env vars are a deprecated alias for `..._RESERVED_SLOTS` — despite the name they set the reservation floor, never a ceiling. They still work but log a warning; migrate to `..._RESERVED_SLOTS`.
> **📝 Consolidation bank priority**
>
`HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_CONSOLIDATION_BANK_PRIORITY` controls which banks' consolidation tasks are claimed first when a slot becomes available. Format: comma-separated `bank-pattern:priority` pairs where higher numbers mean higher priority. Patterns support `*` as a wildcard; a bare `*` is the catch-all default for unlisted banks (defaults to `1` if omitted).

Example:
```
HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_CONSOLIDATION_BANK_PRIORITY="shadow-*:10,staging-*:5,*:1"
```

This ensures `shadow-*` banks are always consolidated before others, even if their tasks were submitted later. Useful for deployments with asymmetric bank sizes where a large bank might be starved by many small banks cycling through limited slots. Bank-serialization (max one concurrent consolidation per bank) is preserved regardless of priority. When unset, consolidation tasks are claimed in `created_at` order (default behavior).
### Performance Optimization

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_SKIP_LLM_VERIFICATION` | Skip LLM connection check on startup | `false` |

#### Bank stats cache

`get_bank_stats` aggregates over `memory_links` (joining `memory_units`), which can be a multi-second scan on banks with millions of rows. Because the result is intentionally approximate — it backs a UI widget and the freshness hint inside `reflect` — it is cached per `(schema, bank)` for a few tens of seconds, which also coalesces concurrent misses onto a single in-flight query. Tune it for high-concurrency or large-bank deployments:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_BANK_STATS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Time-to-live (seconds) for the `get_bank_stats` result cache. `0` disables caching, so every call runs the query. | `60` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_BANK_STATS_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` | Maximum number of cached `(schema, bank)` entries before LRU eviction. Bounds memory in deployments with many banks. | `1024` |

#### Native thread pools

When local embeddings or reranking run in-process, the underlying BLAS/ML libraries (OpenBLAS, OpenMP, MKL) each spawn a worker pool sized to the host CPU count. Because Hindsight already parallelizes across requests via its own thread-pool executors, those native pools oversubscribe the CPU — on a many-core host the process can accumulate well over 100 native threads. This inflates memory and, under contention, can degrade throughput. Hindsight therefore bounds each native pool to **16 threads** (or the number of *available* CPUs, whichever is smaller) by default, capping runaway growth on large hosts while leaving within-call parallelism intact.

"Available" CPUs is the budget actually granted to the process — the smallest of the CPU-affinity set, the cgroup CPU quota (`--cpus` / cpuset), and the host core count. This matters in containers: the BLAS libraries otherwise size their pools to the *host's* cores even when the container is limited to a few, so a `--cpus=4` container on a 64-core host would spawn far more BLAS threads than it can run.

To tune, set any of these to the desired thread count; the value you set is always honored (the default applies only when the variable is unset):

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OMP_NUM_THREADS` | OpenMP worker threads (torch, ONNX Runtime, some BLAS builds) | `min(16, available CPUs)` |
| `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` | OpenBLAS worker threads (numpy's default BLAS) | `min(16, available CPUs)` |
| `MKL_NUM_THREADS` | Intel MKL worker threads (numpy/torch when MKL-backed) | `min(16, available CPUs)` |
| `NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS` | numexpr expression-engine threads | `min(16, available CPUs)` |

For a server handling many concurrent requests, lower values (down to `1`) favor request-level parallelism and minimize thread count; for low-concurrency deployments running large local-model batches, the default leaves room for within-call parallelism. These must be set in the process environment before startup (the libraries read them once, at load time), so they cannot be overridden per-tenant or per-bank.

### Webhooks

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WEBHOOK_URL` | Global webhook URL for event delivery | - (disabled) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | HMAC signing secret for webhook payloads | - (unsigned) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WEBHOOK_EVENT_TYPES` | Comma-separated list of event types to deliver via webhook | `consolidation.completed` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated hosts or IP/CIDR ranges permitted as webhook destinations in addition to public addresses. Private, loopback, and link-local ranges (including the cloud metadata address) are blocked unless listed here. | - (public only) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WEBHOOK_EXPOSE_RESPONSE_BODY` | Return the raw upstream response body in the delivery-history API. Off by default to avoid exposing internal response contents; the delivery status code is always returned. | `false` |

> **⚠️ Webhook destinations are SSRF-guarded**
>
Because webhook URLs are caller-supplied, the delivery worker refuses to send to private, loopback, or link-local addresses (e.g. `169.254.169.254`, `127.0.0.1`, `10.0.0.0/8`) by default, and it does not return upstream response bodies to callers. Use `HINDSIGHT_API_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to allow specific internal destinations (such as `127.0.0.1` for local testing), and `HINDSIGHT_API_WEBHOOK_EXPOSE_RESPONSE_BODY=true` only if you trust those destinations and need the response body for debugging.
### Audit Logging

Audit logging captures mutating operations (retain, recall, reflect, bank config updates, [Memory Defense](memory-defense/index.md) redact/block actions, etc.) into an `audit_log` table, queryable via the `/audit-logs` endpoint.

**Audit logging is disabled by default.** With `HINDSIGHT_API_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=false`, the `audit_log` table stays empty and `/audit-logs` returns `{"total": 0, "items": []}` regardless of activity. Set the flag to `true` and restart the API to start capturing events.

**Auditing can be turned on or off for individual banks.** `audit_log_enabled` is hierarchical — overridable per bank via the [config API](#hierarchical-configuration) or the bank's **Configuration → Audit Logging** toggle in the control plane. The override works in both directions: a bank can opt *in* while the server default is `false`, or opt *out* while the default is `true`. Banks with no override follow the server default. Unlike the env var, a per-bank change takes effect immediately — no restart.

The actions allowlist and retention window stay server-level: retention is a global sweep across all tenants with no bank in scope.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED` | Whether audit events are written. Hierarchical — can be overridden per bank via the config API. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_AUDIT_LOG_ACTIONS` | Comma-separated allowlist of action types to audit (empty = all eligible actions) | `""` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` | Number of days to retain audit log entries. `-1` = keep forever. | `-1` |

### LLM Request Tracing

LLM request tracing records every LLM call Hindsight makes — for retain, reflect, and consolidation — into an `llm_requests` table, queryable per bank via the `/llm-requests` endpoint. Each row captures the input messages, the model output, token usage (input / output / cached / total, taken from the provider response), finish reason, provider/model, timing, and caller metadata. **Failed calls are recorded too** (`status = "error"` with the error message), so the table is useful for debugging what the LLM is doing and why a call failed. Capture is wired into the OpenTelemetry GenAI recording path (the same `record_llm_call` hook used for OTLP span export), so it stays consistent with the provider-reported request details.

**LLM request tracing is enabled by default**, with traced rows retained for 1 day. To disable it entirely set `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_ENABLED=false` and restart the API — the `llm_requests` table then stays empty and `/llm-requests` returns `{"total": 0, "items": []}` regardless of activity.

> **Note:** Traced rows contain the full prompt and model output, which may include sensitive memory content and can be large. Use `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_MAX_CHARS` to bound how much of each payload is stored, tighten `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS`, or set `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_ENABLED=false` to turn tracing off in sensitive environments.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_ENABLED` | Master switch for LLM request tracing. Must be `true` for any calls to be recorded. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_SCOPES` | Comma-separated allowlist of call scopes to trace (e.g. `retain_extract_facts,reflect`; empty = all scopes) | `""` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS` | Number of days to retain trace rows. `-1` = keep forever. | `1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_MAX_CHARS` | Truncate stored input/output beyond this many characters (keeps the row, stores a truncated preview). | `50000` |

### Background Maintenance {#background-maintenance}

A single periodic loop in every API/worker process drives Hindsight's recurring
housekeeping: the `audit_log` / `llm_requests` retention sweeps, terminal
operation cleanup, the consolidation reconcile, and the cron-scheduled mental
model refresh.

The loop runs in **every** process with no leader election, which is safe by
construction — the sweeps are idempotent deletes, and the two jobs that enqueue
work dedupe against in-flight operations inside the inserting transaction. What
it is not is free at scale: each job starts with a cross-tenant discovery call
that probes every schema holding the relevant table, and every process pays that
probe. The cost scales with tenant count while the work it finds does not, so on
a large multi-tenant deployment **the cadences are the knob that matters**.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETENTION_SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | How often expired `audit_log` and `llm_requests` rows are deleted across all tenant schemas. Retention windows are measured in days, so this only affects how promptly expired rows disappear. `0` disables the sweeps. | `3600` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OPERATION_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | How often expired terminal operation rows are pruned. See [Distributed Workers](#distributed-workers) for the retention window and batch size. `0` disables the job. | `900` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MAINTENANCE_START_JITTER_SECONDS` | Upper bound on a random delay applied before a process runs its **first** maintenance tick. Every job is due on that first tick, so without an offset a fleet started together — a deploy or rolling restart — runs every sweep in every process at the same instant. `0` disables the jitter for a deterministic start. | `60` |

> **💡 Tuning for many tenants**
>

At a few hundred tenants the defaults are irrelevant. At tens of thousands, the
per-tick discovery scan dominates, and the jobs whose retention is counted in
*days* have no reason to probe every schema every minute. Raise
`HINDSIGHT_API_OPERATION_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` and
`HINDSIGHT_API_MENTAL_MODEL_REFRESH_TICK_SECONDS` first — they are the two most
frequent sweeps — and keep the jitter enabled so restarts don't align the fleet.

### Programmatic Configuration

You can also configure the API programmatically using `MemoryEngine.from_env()`:

```python
from hindsight_api import MemoryEngine

memory = MemoryEngine.from_env()
await memory.initialize()
```

---

## Observability & Tracing

Hindsight provides OpenTelemetry-based observability for LLM calls, conforming to GenAI semantic conventions.

### OpenTelemetry Tracing

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_TRACES_ENABLED` | Enable distributed tracing for LLM calls | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | OTLP endpoint URL (e.g., Grafana LGTM, Langfuse, etc.) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | Headers for OTLP exporter (format: "key1=value1,key2=value2") | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | Service name for traces. Applies to the API and to standalone workers, which default to `hindsight-worker` when it is unset. | `hindsight-api` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT` | Deployment environment name (e.g., development, staging, production) | `development` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_METRICS_INCLUDE_BANK_ID` | Include `bank_id` in OTel metric attributes. Enable only for deployments with few banks — high cardinality causes unbounded memory growth. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_METRICS_INCLUDE_TENANT` | Include a per-tenant (`tenant`, the schema) label on OTel metrics. Enable only for deployments with few tenants — one series set per tenant, multiplied through every histogram bucket, causes unbounded memory growth. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_DIAGNOSTIC_PHASES` | Record the diagnostic recall phases (`diagnostic="true"` on `hindsight.recall.phase.duration`) — subsets of other phases, useful only while diagnosing. Disable to cut instrument overhead on a busy recall path. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_PHASE_SAMPLE_EVERY` | Record 1 in N `hindsight.recall.phase.duration` observations. Each observation is sampled independently, so percentiles stay unbiased and only the histogram counts scale by 1/N. Raise it (e.g. `10`) to cut metrics CPU at high recall rates. | `1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_METRICS_BACKLOG_ENABLED` | Expose async-operation queue depth and consolidation-backlog gauges (`hindsight_async_operations`, `hindsight_consolidation_backlog`, `hindsight_consolidation_failed`). Runs periodic per-schema `COUNT` queries on a background task. | `false` |
| `OTEL_PYTHON_FASTAPI_EXCLUDED_URLS` | Comma-separated URL patterns excluded from request tracing | `health,metrics` |

**Features:**
- Continues the caller's trace when a `traceparent` header is present
- Full prompts and completions recorded as events
- Token usage tracking (input/output)
- Model and provider information
- Error tracking with finish reasons
- Conforms to OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions v1.37+

**OTLP-Compatible Backends:**

The tracing implementation uses standard OTLP HTTP protocol, so it works with any OTLP-compatible backend:
- **Grafana LGTM** (Recommended for local dev): All-in-one stack with Tempo traces, Loki logs, Mimir metrics, and Grafana UI
- **Langfuse**: LLM-focused observability and analytics
- **OpenLIT**: Built-in LLM dashboards, cost tracking
- **DataDog, New Relic, Honeycomb**: Commercial platforms

**Example Configuration:**

```bash
# Enable tracing
export HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_TRACES_ENABLED=true

# Configure endpoint (example: OpenLIT Cloud)
export HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp.openlit.io
export HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer olit-xxx"

# Optional: Custom service name and environment
export HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=hindsight-production
export HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

**Local Development:**

For local development, we recommend the Grafana LGTM stack which provides traces, metrics, and logs in a single container:

```bash
./scripts/dev/start-grafana.sh
```

See `scripts/dev/grafana/README.md` for detailed setup instructions.

Other options: See `scripts/dev/openlit/README.md` for OpenLIT or `scripts/dev/jaeger/README.md` for standalone Jaeger.

### Runtime-Stall Diagnostics

The API and worker run the `/health` handler and all task work on a single asyncio
event loop, and `/health` acquires a database connection. So a liveness probe can
fail for two very different reasons: the **event loop is blocked** by synchronous
work (a restart helps), or the **connection pool is exhausted** and `/health` can't
get a connection even though the loop is idle (a restart usually doesn't help). These
diagnostics tell the two apart from the logs and metrics alone, instead of leaving
you with an opaque restart.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOOP_WATCHDOG_ENABLED` | Run a background thread that detects event-loop stalls and logs the blocking stack. Also emits `hindsight_event_loop_stalls` / `hindsight_event_loop_stall_duration`. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOOP_WATCHDOG_STALL_THRESHOLD_MS` | Log a stall once the loop is unresponsive for at least this long. | `1000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOOP_WATCHDOG_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | How often the watchdog thread pings the loop. | `250` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_ACQUIRE_WARN_THRESHOLD_MS` | Log a warning (with pool stats) when acquiring a pooled connection waits at least this long. | `1000` |

The DB-pool acquire path also exposes `hindsight_db_pool_waiting` (callers currently
queued for a connection) and the `hindsight_db_pool_acquire_wait` histogram. A slow
or failing `/health` response additionally carries `db_acquire_ms`, `db_pool_waiting`,
`db_pool_in_use`, and `db_pool_max` for triage.

### CPU Profiling

The loop watchdog above answers "is the loop blocked?". This answers the next question --
*what is burning the CPU?* -- for a process you may not be able to attach a debugger to.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_PROFILE` | JSON object; unset disables profiling entirely. `{"every": 60, "top": 20}` | unset |

`every` is the seconds between reports, `top` the rows in each. Set it and the API emits a
CPU report to its normal log stream on that interval:

```
HINDSIGHT_API_PROFILE='{"every": 60, "top": 20}'
```

```
[profile] thread hindsight-loop-            1.41 cores
[profile] thread asyncio_                   0.37 cores
[profile] 1598 functions active in the last 60s
[profile] tottime=0.923 cumtime=1.833 ncalls=15842 <method 'encode' of 'builtins.CoreBPE' objects>
[profile] tottime=0.691 cumtime=7.039 ncalls=1511590 <built-in method builtins.isinstance>
```

Each row is one log record tagged `[profile]`, so `grep '\[profile\]'` over the logs
reconstructs the table.

**It reports to the logs on purpose.** The case this exists for is a process dying without
explanation. A file inside the container dies with the container unless a volume was mounted
in advance, and an HTTP endpoint needs a live process and a route to it -- which is exactly
what a crashing process does not offer. Container runtimes keep the previous container's
stdout (`kubectl logs --previous`), so the last report before a crash is still readable
afterwards. Each report is flushed as it is written, because a fatal signal takes buffered
output with it.

#### Reading the report

Every report begins with per-thread CPU read from `/proc`, and that table is the arbiter:
profiler overhead cannot distort it, so when the two disagree, `/proc` is right. It also
shows whether work is spread across event loops or concentrated on one.

Three things will mislead you otherwise:

- **`tottime` is a function's own CPU; `cumtime` includes everything it called.** A
  coroutine high in `cumtime` may simply be awaiting. Ranking by `cumtime` once put an ASGI
  middleware at 77% of loop CPU when removing it changed throughput by 13%.
- **cProfile roughly halves throughput and over-weights functions called very often.** Read
  the ranking, not the milliseconds, and confirm anything load-bearing by changing one thing
  and re-measuring.
- **Numbers are per-window.** Each report is the delta since the previous one, not a running
  total since boot.

#### Limits

Profiling is process-wide and single-instance: since Python 3.12 the profiler is a global
monitoring tool, so nothing else in the process may profile at the same time (a second
attempt logs `tool 2 is already in use` and leaves profiling off). `py-spy` remains the
better tool when you can attach to the process; this exists for the cases where you cannot.

### Metrics

Hindsight exposes Prometheus metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint, including:
- LLM call duration and token usage
- Operation duration (retain/recall/reflect)
- HTTP request metrics
- Database connection pool metrics

Metrics are always enabled and available at `http://localhost:8888/metrics`.

---

## Control Plane

The Control Plane is the web UI for managing memory banks.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_CP_DATAPLANE_API_URL` | URL of the API service | `http://localhost:8888` |
| `HINDSIGHT_CP_DATAPLANE_API_KEY` | Bearer token the Control Plane sends as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on every request to the API service. Required when the API service is auth-protected; omit for a public API. | *(none — no `Authorization` header sent)* |
| `HINDSIGHT_CP_ACCESS_KEY` | Access key to protect the Control Plane UI. When set, users must enter this key to log in. | *(none — auth disabled)* |
| `HINDSIGHT_CP_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE` | Maximum size of a single file-upload request the Control Plane accepts before truncating it. Accepts a size string (`100mb`, `1gb`) or a number of bytes. Raise this to upload files larger than the default, and keep it in line with the API's `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_CONVERSION_MAX_BATCH_SIZE_MB`. | `100mb` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` | Base path for Control Plane UI when behind reverse proxy (e.g., `/hindsight`) | `""` (root) |

```bash
# Point Control Plane to a remote API service
export HINDSIGHT_CP_DATAPLANE_API_URL=http://api.example.com:8888

# Authenticate to an auth-protected API service
export HINDSIGHT_CP_DATAPLANE_API_KEY=my-dataplane-bearer-token

# Protect the Control Plane with an access key
export HINDSIGHT_CP_ACCESS_KEY=my-secret-key
```

### Hierarchical Configuration

Hindsight supports per-bank configuration overrides through a hierarchical system: **Global (env vars) → Tenant → Bank**.

#### Type-Safe Config Access

To prevent accidentally using global defaults when bank-specific overrides exist, Hindsight enforces type-safe config access:

**In Application Code:**
```python
from hindsight_api.config import get_config

# ✅ Access static (infrastructure) fields
config = get_config()
host = config.host  # OK - static field
port = config.port  # OK - static field

# ❌ Attempting to access bank-configurable fields raises an error
chunk_size = config.retain_chunk_size  # ConfigFieldAccessError!
```

**Error Message:**
```
ConfigFieldAccessError: Field 'retain_chunk_size' is bank-configurable and cannot
be accessed from global config. Use ConfigResolver.resolve_full_config(bank_id, context)
to get bank-specific config.
```

**For Bank-Specific Config:**
```python
# Internal code that needs bank-specific settings
from hindsight_api.config_resolver import ConfigResolver

# Resolve full config for a specific bank
config = await config_resolver.resolve_full_config(bank_id, request_context)
chunk_size = config.retain_chunk_size  # ✅ Uses bank-specific value
```

This design prevents bugs where global defaults are used instead of bank overrides, making it impossible to make this mistake at compile/development time.

#### Security Model

Configuration fields are categorized for security:

1. **Configurable Fields** - Safe behavioral settings that can be customized per-bank:
   - Retention: `retain_chunk_size`, `retain_structured_chunk_size`, `retain_extraction_mode`, `retain_mission`, `retain_custom_instructions`
   - Observations: `enable_observations`, `enable_auto_consolidation`, `observations_mission`, `max_observations_per_scope`
   - MCP access control: `mcp_enabled_tools`

2. **Credential Fields** - NEVER exposed or configurable via API:
   - API keys: `*_api_key` (all LLM API keys)
   - Infrastructure: `*_base_url` (all base URLs)

3. **Static Fields** - Server-level only, cannot be overridden:
   - Infrastructure: `database_url`, `port`, `host`, `worker_count`
   - Provider/Model selection: `llm_provider`, `llm_model` (requires presets - not yet implemented)
   - Performance tuning: `llm_max_concurrent`, `llm_timeout`, retrieval settings, optimization flags

#### Concurrent Config Writes

Config writes to the same bank are serialized. Validation and persistence run as
one unit: the write locks the bank row, re-checks the update against the
overrides actually committed at that moment, and only then merges it. Two
requests can therefore never combine into a configuration that neither of them
validated — for example one raising `retain_chunk_size` while the other removes
the retain strategy that made the larger size legal.

There is no conflict status to handle and no retry to implement. A request that
loses the race is rejected with the same `400` validation error it would have
received had the two updates arrived one after the other; a request whose fields
are still valid against the newer state succeeds. Fields that no constraint spans
are merged independently, so unrelated concurrent updates all survive.

#### Enabling the API

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_BANK_CONFIG_API` | Allow clients to change per-bank configuration (`PATCH`/`DELETE .../config`). Reading a bank's config is always allowed. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_BANK_LLM_HEALTH` | Enable the per-bank LLM connectivity probe (`POST /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/health/llm`). It makes a real provider call, so it is **off by default** — enable it to expose the endpoint. Returns status only — never the provider/model/endpoint. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_DRY_RUN_EXTRACT` | Enable the dry-run extraction preview endpoint (`POST /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/memories/dry-run-extract`). Runs extraction only — makes a real LLM call but stores nothing. Set to `false` to remove the endpoint (returns `404`). | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DEFAULT_BANK_TEMPLATE` | Bank template manifest (JSON) applied automatically to every newly-created bank. See below. | _(unset)_ |

##### `HINDSIGHT_API_DEFAULT_BANK_TEMPLATE`

Server-level default bank template. When set, the manifest is applied once
to every bank the server creates — triggered the first time a bank is
touched (via `PUT /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}`, `/import`, `/retain`, etc.).
The value is a JSON-encoded `BankTemplateManifest` with the same shape
accepted by `POST /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/import` (see the `bank`,
`mental_models`, and `directives` sections in the Bank Templates API).

Precedence: fields set by the template become per-bank overrides, so they
take precedence over the equivalent `HINDSIGHT_API_*` env-var defaults
(e.g. `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE`). Users can still override
individual fields later via `PATCH /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/config`;
the template is **not** re-applied on subsequent accesses, so explicit
overrides are never clobbered.

A malformed manifest (bad JSON, unknown version, schema errors) is logged
and ignored — bank creation still succeeds with plain defaults, so a
broken server-level setting cannot wedge all callers.

Example (compact, single-line JSON as required by env vars):

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_DEFAULT_BANK_TEMPLATE='{"version":"1","bank":{"reflect_mission":"Help support agents remember customer interactions.","retain_extraction_mode":"verbose","disposition_empathy":5},"directives":[{"name":"Be concise","content":"Always respond concisely.","priority":10}]}'
```

#### API Endpoints

- `GET /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/config` - View resolved config (filtered by permissions)
- `PATCH /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/config` - Update bank overrides (only allowed fields)
- `DELETE /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/config` - Reset to defaults

#### Permission System

Tenant extensions can control which fields banks are allowed to modify via `get_allowed_config_fields()`:

```python
class CustomTenantExtension(TenantExtension):
    async def get_allowed_config_fields(self, context, bank_id):
        # Option 1: Allow all configurable fields
        return None

        # Option 2: Allow specific fields only
        return {"retain_chunk_size", "retain_custom_instructions"}

        # Option 3: Read-only (no modifications)
        return set()
```

#### Examples

```bash
# Update retention settings for a bank
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8888/v1/default/banks/config-demo-bank/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "updates": {
      "retain_chunk_size": 4000,
      "retain_extraction_mode": "custom",
      "retain_custom_instructions": "Focus on technical details and implementation specifics"
    }
  }'

# Note: retain_extraction_mode must be "custom" to use retain_custom_instructions

# View resolved config (respects permissions)
curl http://localhost:8888/v1/default/banks/config-demo-bank/config

# Reset to defaults
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8888/v1/default/banks/config-demo-bank/config
```

**Security Notes:**
- Credentials (API keys, base URLs) are never returned in responses
- Only configurable fields can be modified
- Responses are filtered by tenant permissions
- Attempting to set credentials returns 400 error

### Reverse Proxy / Subpath Deployment

To deploy Hindsight under a subpath (e.g., `example.com/hindsight/`):

1. Set both environment variables to the same path:
   ```bash
   HINDSIGHT_API_BASE_PATH=/hindsight
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/hindsight
   ```

2. Configure your reverse proxy to:
   - Forward `/hindsight/*` requests to Hindsight
   - Preserve the full path in forwarded requests
   - Set appropriate proxy headers (X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-For)

**Example: Nginx Configuration**

```nginx
location /hindsight/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8888/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

**Example: Traefik Configuration**

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    hindsight:
      rule: "PathPrefix(`/hindsight`)"
      service: hindsight
      middlewares:
        - hindsight-stripprefix

  middlewares:
    hindsight-stripprefix:
      stripPrefix:
        prefixes:
          - "/hindsight"

**Important Notes:**
- The base path must start with `/` and should NOT end with `/`
- Both API and Control Plane should use the same base path
- After setting environment variables, restart both services
- OpenAPI docs will be available at `<base-path>/docs` (e.g., `/hindsight/docs`)

**Complete Examples:**

See `docker/compose-examples/` directory for:
- Nginx configuration files (`simple.conf`, `api-and-control-plane.conf`)
- Docker Compose setups (`docker-compose.yml`, `reverse-proxy-only.yml`)
- Traefik and other reverse proxy examples
- Full deployment documentation
