# Memory Defense

Hindsight scrubs secrets and PII from retain content using a 45-pattern regex set. Each match is replaced with a `[REDACTED:type]` marker before content reaches memory units or the document body. The feature is configured per bank and disabled by default.

## How it works

Memory Defense is opt-in per bank. The extension is always present, but it sits dormant until you give a bank a policy that turns it on. When a policy is set, every memory the agent writes to that bank is scanned before it lands in storage. When the scanner recognizes a credential, an API key, a database connection string, or a known PII format, the matched substring is replaced with a redaction marker like `[REDACTED:github_token]`.

The scrubbed version is what actually gets stored. Memory units and document bodies persist the redacted text, so future recall responses, exports, and reflect operations never see the original secret.

A policy only affects future retain calls on the bank where it is set. Existing memories are not retroactively scanned when you add or change a policy.

## Configuring Memory Defense

Memory Defense is configured per bank via the bank's `memory_defense` config field. You can set the policy at bank creation time or update it later via `PATCH /v1/{tenant}/banks/{bank_id}/config`.

The open-source version implements the `sensitive_data` rule with two possible actions:

- **`redact`** — replace each matched secret with a `[REDACTED:type]` marker and store the scrubbed memory.
- **`block`** — drop any item that contains a match. If every item in a retain request is blocked, the call returns `422`.

A minimal policy:

```json
{
  "memory_defense": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": [
      { "on": "sensitive_data", "action": "redact" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Once that policy is on a bank, every retain to that bank is screened with the 45 redaction patterns documented below.

:::note Existing memories are not retroactively scanned
Enabling Memory Defense on a bank only affects future retain calls. Memories already in the bank are not re-scanned or modified when you add or change a policy. If you need to scrub a bank that already contains unredacted content, you have to re-ingest the affected memories or remove them manually.

### Disabled by default

Memory Defense is off on every bank until you set a policy. A bank with no `memory_defense` field, with `enabled: false`, or with no `sensitive_data` rule is treated identically: the extension returns ALLOW and content passes through unchanged. To stop redacting on a bank that has it on, set `enabled: false` or remove the policy.

## Notifications

When an item is redacted or blocked, Hindsight fires a [`memory_defense.triggered` webhook](../api/webhooks.mdx#memory_defensetriggered) if a webhook on the bank is subscribed to that event type. The payload reports the action taken, the document ID, and which redaction patterns matched — useful for routing security alerts to a SIEM or Slack. Clean items fire no event.

The same redact/block decisions are also recorded as `memory_defense` entries in the [audit log](../configuration.mdx#audit-logging) (when audit logging is enabled), with the action and matched pattern labels in the entry metadata.
