# GitHub Copilot

Long-term memory for [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) in VS Code, powered by [Hindsight](https://vectorize.io/hindsight). One command connects Copilot's agent mode to the Hindsight MCP server and adds a recall/retain rule — so Copilot recalls relevant memory at the start of a task and retains durable facts as it works.

## How It Works

VS Code Copilot supports two things this integration uses:

- **MCP servers** via `.vscode/mcp.json` (agent mode), including **HTTP servers** with headers — so the Hindsight MCP endpoint connects directly:

  ```json
  {
    "servers": {
      "hindsight": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io/mcp/my-project/",
        "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer hsk_..." }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**, which Copilot applies to every chat in the workspace — that's where the recall/retain rule lives.

## Setup

```bash
pip install hindsight-copilot
cd your-project
hindsight-copilot init --api-token YOUR_HINDSIGHT_API_KEY --bank-id my-project
```

`init` merges the `servers` entry into `./.vscode/mcp.json` and writes the rule into `./.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Reload VS Code, open Copilot Chat in **agent mode**, and start the `hindsight` MCP server from the chat's tools menu.

Use a [Hindsight Cloud](https://hindsight.vectorize.io) key, or a self-hosted server with `--api-url http://localhost:8888` (no token needed for an open local server). If `mcp.json` has comments, `init` prints the snippet to paste instead — or run `hindsight-copilot init --print-only` anytime.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `hindsight-copilot init` | Add the MCP server + recall/retain rule |
| `hindsight-copilot status` | Show whether the server + rule are configured |
| `hindsight-copilot uninstall` | Remove the server + rule |

See the [package README](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight/tree/main/hindsight-integrations/github-copilot) for full configuration options.
