# Claude Code

> **⚠️ Superseded by the Coding Agents plugin**
>
**The Claude Code plugin** is superseded by the [Coding Agents plugin](coding-agents.md) — one
package covering Claude Code, Codex, opencode, Kilo, Cursor, Copilot, Grok, Antigravity, Devin and Cline and other CLI agents, with a per-repo memory bank they all share instead
of one bank per agent.

This page and the published package still work; they are no longer developed. To switch:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
npx @vectorize-io/hindsight-coding-agents install claude-code --import-conversations
```

Two things move, and nothing else does.

**Your server moves automatically.** `install` reads `~/.hindsight/claude-code.json` and keeps the same
`apiUrl` and token — an empty URL still means the local daemon — so you are not silently switched
to Hindsight Cloud. Pass `--server` to change it.

**Your conversations are re-imported from local transcripts** by `--import-conversations`, as new
documents. They are not copied from the old bank: that bank's default was a single static bank
shared by every project, and its documents record only a session id, so working out which ones
belong to this repo means reading the local transcripts anyway.

**Nothing else carries over.** The old `recall*` and `retain*` settings, missions and bank-naming
options describe a pipeline this package replaced. Bank naming changes too — one bank per repo,
shared by every agent. See
[Migrating from the per-agent plugins](coding-agents.md#migrating-from-the-per-agent-plugins).
Biomimetic long-term memory for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) using [Hindsight](https://vectorize.io/hindsight). Automatically captures conversations, recalls relevant context, and exposes knowledge tools and a subagent-creation skill so Claude can read and write its own memory.

> **💡 Works in Grok Build too**
>
Grok Build natively supports Claude Code plugins. See the [Grok Build integration guide](grok-build.md) for Grok-specific setup.
## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Add the Hindsight marketplace and install the plugin
claude plugin marketplace add vectorize-io/hindsight
claude plugin install hindsight-memory

# 2. Configure your LLM provider for memory extraction
# Option A: OpenAI (auto-detected)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"

# Option B: Anthropic (auto-detected)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"

# Option C: No API key needed (uses Claude Code's own model — personal/local use only)
export HINDSIGHT_LLM_PROVIDER=claude-code

# Option D: Connect to an external Hindsight server instead of running locally
mkdir -p ~/.hindsight
echo '{"hindsightApiUrl": "https://your-hindsight-server.com"}' > ~/.hindsight/claude-code.json

# 3. Start Claude Code — the plugin activates automatically
claude
```

That's it! The plugin will automatically start capturing and recalling memories.

## Features

- **Auto-recall** — on every user prompt, queries Hindsight for relevant memories and injects them as context (invisible to the chat transcript, visible to Claude)
- **Auto-retain** — after every response (or every N turns), extracts and retains conversation content to Hindsight for long-term storage
- **Knowledge tools** — Claude can read, write, and search its own memory via MCP tools (knowledge pages, recall, ingest)
- **Subagent skill** — `/hindsight-memory:create-agent` scaffolds a subagent backed by an isolated memory bank
- **Dynamic bank IDs** — per-agent, per-project, or per-session memory isolation (so each subagent gets its own brain)
- **Daemon management** — can auto-start/stop `hindsight-embed` locally or connect to an external Hindsight server
- **Channel-agnostic** — works with Claude Code Channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack) or interactive sessions

## Architecture

The plugin combines hooks (for automatic recall/retain) with an MCP server (for explicit knowledge tools) and a skill (for subagent creation):

| Component | Trigger | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `session_start.py` | `SessionStart` hook | Health check — verify Hindsight is reachable |
| `recall.py` | `UserPromptSubmit` hook | **Auto-recall** — query memories, inject as `additionalContext` |
| `retain.py` | `Stop` hook | **Auto-retain** — extract transcript, POST to Hindsight (async) |
| `session_end.py` | `SessionEnd` hook | Cleanup — stop auto-managed daemon if started |
| `mcp_server.py` | MCP server | Exposes `agent_knowledge_*` tools — list/get/create/update/delete pages, recall, ingest |
| `create-agent` | Skill | Scaffolds a subagent file under `~/.claude/agents/` and seeds its bank |

Python dependencies (`mcp`) are bootstrapped on first run into a private venv under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/venv` — no global pip install, isolated to the plugin, survives plugin updates.

## Connection Modes

### 1. External API (recommended for production)

Connect to a running Hindsight server (cloud or self-hosted). No local LLM needed — the server handles fact extraction.

```json
{
  "hindsightApiUrl": "https://your-hindsight-server.com",
  "hindsightApiToken": "your-token"
}
```

### 2. Local Daemon (auto-managed)

The plugin automatically starts and stops `hindsight-embed` via `uvx`. Requires an LLM provider API key for local fact extraction.

Set an LLM provider:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
# or
export HINDSIGHT_LLM_PROVIDER=claude-code # No API key needed
```

The model is selected automatically by the Hindsight API. To override, set `HINDSIGHT_LLM_MODEL`.

### 3. Existing Local Server

If you already have `hindsight-embed` running, leave `hindsightApiUrl` empty and set `apiPort` to match your server's port. The plugin will detect it automatically.

## Configuration

All settings live in `~/.hindsight/claude-code.json`. Every setting can also be overridden via environment variables. The plugin ships with sensible defaults — you only need to configure what you want to change.

**Loading order** (later entries win):
1. Built-in defaults (hardcoded in the plugin)
2. Plugin `settings.json` (ships with the plugin, at `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/settings.json`)
3. User config (`~/.hindsight/claude-code.json` — recommended for your overrides)
4. Environment variables

---

### Connection & Daemon

These settings control how the plugin connects to the Hindsight API.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `hindsightApiUrl` | `HINDSIGHT_API_URL` | `""` (empty) | URL of an external Hindsight API server. When empty, the plugin uses a local daemon instead. |
| `hindsightApiToken` | `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN` | `null` | Authentication token for the external API. Only needed when `hindsightApiUrl` is set. |
| `apiPort` | `HINDSIGHT_API_PORT` | `9077` | Port used by the local `hindsight-embed` daemon. Change this if you run multiple instances or have a port conflict. |
| `embedVersion` | `HINDSIGHT_EMBED_VERSION` | `"latest"` | Which version of `hindsight-embed` to install via `uvx`. Pin to a specific version (e.g. `"0.5.2"`) for reproducibility. |
| `embedPackagePath` | `HINDSIGHT_EMBED_PACKAGE_PATH` | `null` | Local filesystem path to a `hindsight-embed` checkout. When set, the plugin runs from this path instead of installing via `uvx`. Useful for development. |
| `requestTimeoutSeconds` | `HINDSIGHT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `null` | Overrides the per-call request timeout for recall (default `10s`), retain (default `15s`) and knowledge tool calls (`10–15s`). When unset, the per-call defaults are preserved. Bump this when self-hosted Hindsight legitimately takes longer than 10s under contention (e.g. parallel recalls), to avoid client-side `read operation timed out` errors on requests the server completes successfully. Does not affect the health check, which intentionally stays fast (5s). |

---

### LLM Provider (local daemon only)

These settings configure which LLM the local daemon uses for fact extraction. They are **ignored** when connecting to an external API (the server uses its own LLM configuration).

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `llmProvider` | `HINDSIGHT_LLM_PROVIDER` | auto-detect | Which LLM provider to use. Supported values: `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `groq`, `ollama`, `ollama-cloud`, `openai-codex`, `claude-code`. When omitted, the plugin auto-detects by checking for API key env vars in order: `OPENAI_API_KEY` → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → `GEMINI_API_KEY` → `GROQ_API_KEY`. |
| `llmModel` | `HINDSIGHT_LLM_MODEL` | provider default | Override the default model for the chosen provider (e.g. `"gpt-4o"`, `"claude-sonnet-4-20250514"`). When omitted, the Hindsight API picks a sensible default for each provider. |
| `llmApiKeyEnv` | — | provider standard | Name of the environment variable that holds the API key. Normally auto-detected (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the `openai` provider). Set this only if your key is in a non-standard env var. |

---

### Memory Bank

A **bank** is an isolated memory store — like a separate "brain." These settings control which bank the plugin reads from and writes to.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `bankId` | `HINDSIGHT_BANK_ID` | `"claude_code"` | The bank ID to use when `dynamicBankId` is `false`. All sessions share this single bank. |
| `bankMission` | `HINDSIGHT_BANK_MISSION` | generic assistant prompt | A short description of the agent's identity and purpose. Sent to Hindsight when creating or updating the bank, and used during recall to contextualize results. |
| `retainMission` | — | extraction prompt | Instructions for the fact extraction LLM — tells it *what* to extract from conversations (e.g. "Extract technical decisions and user preferences"). |
| `dynamicBankId` | `HINDSIGHT_DYNAMIC_BANK_ID` | `false` | When `true`, the plugin derives a unique bank ID from context fields (see `dynamicBankGranularity`), giving each combination its own isolated memory. |
| `dynamicBankGranularity` | — | `["agent", "project"]` | Which context fields to combine when building a dynamic bank ID. Available fields: `agent` (agent name), `project` (working directory), `session` (session ID), `channel` (channel ID), `user` (user ID). |
| `bankIdPrefix` | — | `""` | A string prepended to all bank IDs — both static and dynamic. Useful for namespacing (e.g. `"prod"` or `"staging"`). |
| `agentName` | `HINDSIGHT_AGENT_NAME` | `"claude-code"` | Name used for the `agent` field in dynamic bank ID derivation. |
| `resolveWorktrees` | — | `true` | When deriving the `project` field, resolve git worktrees to the **main repository's basename** so that all worktrees of the same repo share one bank. Set to `false` to use the literal working directory basename instead (each worktree gets its own bank). |
| `directoryBankMap` | — | `{}` | Explicit `{ "/path/to/dir": "bank-id" }` mapping. When the current working directory matches an entry, that bank is used directly — overrides both static and dynamic resolution. `bankIdPrefix` still applies on top. |

#### Worktrees and explicit mapping

By default, all git worktrees of the same repository share one bank. For example, if you keep a main checkout at `/home/me/myproject` and a worktree at `/home/me/myproject-wt1`, both resolve to `project = "myproject"` — so dynamic bank IDs like `claude-code::myproject` are stable across all worktrees. This avoids fragmenting memory across short-lived branches.

If you want each worktree to have its own bank, set `"resolveWorktrees": false`.

For full control, use `directoryBankMap` to pin specific directories to specific bank IDs:

```json
{
  "directoryBankMap": {
    "/home/me/work/client-a": "client-a-memories",
    "/home/me/personal/blog": "blog"
  }
}
```

When `cwd` matches one of the keys, that bank is used immediately — no static or dynamic resolution runs. Directories not listed fall through to the normal logic.

### Auto-Recall

Auto-recall runs on every user prompt. It queries Hindsight for relevant memories and injects them into Claude's context as invisible `additionalContext` (the user doesn't see them in the chat transcript).

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `autoRecall` | `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RECALL` | `true` | Master switch for auto-recall. Set to `false` to disable memory retrieval entirely. |
| `recallBudget` | `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_BUDGET` | `"mid"` | Controls how hard Hindsight searches for memories. `"low"` = fast, fewer strategies; `"mid"` = balanced; `"high"` = thorough, slower. Affects latency directly. |
| `recallMaxTokens` | `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_MAX_TOKENS` | `1024` | Maximum number of tokens in the recalled memory block. Lower values reduce context usage but may truncate relevant memories. |
| `recallTypes` | — | `["observation"]` | Which memory types to retrieve. `"world"` = general facts; `"experience"` = personal experiences; `"observation"` = consolidated, deduplicated beliefs built from multiple facts. Defaults to observations so the same answer doesn't surface multiple times when many raw memories say the same thing. |
| `recallContextTurns` | `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_CONTEXT_TURNS` | `1` | How many prior conversation turns to include when composing the recall query. `1` = only the latest user message; higher values give more context but may dilute the query. |
| `recallMaxQueryChars` | `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_MAX_QUERY_CHARS` | `800` | Maximum character length of the query sent to Hindsight. Longer queries are truncated. |
| `recallRoles` | — | `["user", "assistant"]` | Which message roles to include when building the recall query from prior turns. |
| `recallPromptPreamble` | — | built-in string | Text placed above the recalled memories in the injected context block. Customize this to change how Claude interprets the memories. |

---

### Auto-Retain

Auto-retain runs after Claude responds. It extracts the conversation transcript and sends it to Hindsight for long-term storage and fact extraction.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `autoRetain` | `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RETAIN` | `true` | Master switch for auto-retain. Set to `false` to disable memory storage entirely. |
| `retainMode` | `HINDSIGHT_RETAIN_MODE` | `"full-session"` | Retention strategy. `"full-session"` sends the full conversation transcript (with chunking). |
| `retainEveryNTurns` | — | `10` | How often to retain. `1` = every turn; `10` = every 10th turn. Higher values reduce API calls but delay memory capture. Values > 1 enable **chunked retention** with a sliding window. |
| `retainOverlapTurns` | — | `2` | When chunked retention fires, this many extra turns from the previous chunk are included for continuity. Total window size = `retainEveryNTurns + retainOverlapTurns`. |
| `retainRoles` | — | `["user", "assistant"]` | Which message roles to include in the retained transcript. |
| `retainToolCalls` | — | `true` | Whether to include tool calls (function invocations and results) in the retained transcript. Captures structured actions like file reads, searches, and code edits. |
| `retainTags` | — | `["{session_id}"]` | Tags attached to the retained document. Supports `{session_id}` placeholder which is replaced with the current session ID at runtime. |
| `retainMetadata` | — | `{}` | Arbitrary key-value metadata attached to the retained document. |
| `retainContext` | — | `"claude-code"` | A label attached to retained memories identifying their source. Useful when multiple integrations write to the same bank. |

---

### Knowledge Tools

The plugin runs an MCP server that exposes `agent_knowledge_*` tools, letting Claude explicitly read, write, and search its memory bank — as opposed to the hook-driven recall/retain which is fully automatic. None of the tools accept a `bank_id` parameter; the server resolves the active bank from the same config as the hooks, so tools and hooks always agree on which bank they touch.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `agent_knowledge_get_current_bank` | Reports the bank ID the current session is bound to. |
| `agent_knowledge_list_pages` | Lists all knowledge pages (mental models) with IDs and names. |
| `agent_knowledge_get_page` | Reads the full synthesized content of a specific page. |
| `agent_knowledge_create_page` | Creates a new knowledge page with a `source_query` that re-synthesizes content after each consolidation. |
| `agent_knowledge_update_page` | Updates a page's name or `source_query`. |
| `agent_knowledge_delete_page` | Permanently deletes a knowledge page. |
| `agent_knowledge_recall` | Searches across retained conversations and documents for specific facts. |
| `agent_knowledge_ingest` | Uploads raw text content into the bank as a document. |
| `agent_knowledge_ingest_file` | Reads a file from disk and ingests its full content. |

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enableKnowledgeTools` | `HINDSIGHT_ENABLE_KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS` | `true` | Master switch for the MCP knowledge tools. When `false`, the MCP server stays alive as an empty server exposing no `agent_knowledge_*` tools (it does not exit — exiting would trigger a `-32000` reconnect error in Claude Code). |

---

### Subagents with Memory

The `/hindsight-memory:create-agent` skill creates a Claude Code subagent backed by its own Hindsight bank. Each subagent's prompt instructs it to use the knowledge tools above for recall and ingestion, so Claude treats persistent memory as a first-class capability of that agent.

Two modes:

- **From a directory** — `/hindsight-memory:create-agent <name> from <path>` ingests every text file under `<path>` (`.md`, `.txt`, `.html`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.xml`), creates a starter set of knowledge pages, and writes the subagent file to `~/.claude/agents/<name>.md`. If the directory contains a `bank-template.json` listing exact `mental_models`, those are used verbatim instead of auto-generated.
- **Interactive** — `/hindsight-memory:create-agent` (no arguments) prompts for the agent name and purpose, then writes the subagent file with no ingestion.

For per-subagent memory isolation, enable dynamic bank IDs:

```json
{
  "dynamicBankId": true,
  "dynamicBankGranularity": ["agent", "project"],
  "enableKnowledgeTools": true
}
```

With `["agent", "project"]`, each subagent gets a unique bank per repository — `<agent-name>::<project-basename>`. Switch to `["agent"]` for a single bank per subagent across all projects, or `["agent", "session"]` for ephemeral per-session banks.

---

### Debug

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `debug` | `HINDSIGHT_DEBUG` | `false` | Enable verbose logging to stderr. All log lines are prefixed with `[Hindsight]`. Useful for diagnosing connection issues, recall/retain behavior, and bank ID derivation. |

## Claude Code Channels

With [Claude Code Channels](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Claude Code can operate as a persistent background agent connected to Telegram, Discord, Slack, and other messaging platforms. This plugin gives Channel-based agents the same long-term memory that `hindsight-openclaw` provides for Openclaw agents.

For Channel agents, enable dynamic bank IDs for per-channel/per-user memory isolation:

```json
{
  "dynamicBankId": true,
  "dynamicBankGranularity": ["agent", "channel", "user"]
}
```

And set channel context via environment variables:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_CHANNEL_ID="telegram-group-12345"
export HINDSIGHT_USER_ID="user-67890"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin not activating**: Check Claude Code logs for `[Hindsight]` messages. Enable `"debug": true` in `~/.hindsight/claude-code.json`.

**Recall returning no memories**: Verify the Hindsight server is reachable (`curl http://localhost:9077/health`). Memories need at least one retain cycle before they're available.

**Daemon not starting**: Ensure an LLM API key is set (or use `HINDSIGHT_LLM_PROVIDER=claude-code`). Review daemon logs at `~/.hindsight/profiles/claude-code.log`.

**High latency on recall**: The recall hook has a 12-second timeout. Use `recallBudget: "low"` or reduce `recallMaxTokens` for faster responses.

**Knowledge tools missing from Claude**: Make sure `enableKnowledgeTools` is `true` in `~/.hindsight/claude-code.json` and restart Claude Code. The first launch after enabling them takes ~20–30 seconds to bootstrap the Python venv at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/venv`; subsequent launches are instant.
