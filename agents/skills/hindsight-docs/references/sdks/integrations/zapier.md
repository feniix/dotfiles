# Zapier

Long-term agent memory for [Zapier](https://zapier.com) via [Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io). The Hindsight Zapier app adds three actions — **Retain**, **Recall**, **Reflect** — plus instant **triggers** that start a Zap when a memory event fires, so memory flows between Hindsight and 7,000+ apps.

## Why this matters

Zapier connects everything: Gmail, Slack, Sheets, HubSpot, Notion, forms, and thousands more. On its own, those Zaps are **stateless**. With Hindsight you can:

- **Retain** every closed ticket, form submission, or call summary into a memory bank
- **Recall** relevant context before an AI step so the model sees prior history
- **Reflect** to get a synthesized, memory-grounded answer right inside a Zap
- **Trigger** a Zap the moment a memory operation completes (e.g. notify Slack when consolidation finishes)

## Setup

> **💡 Recommended: Hindsight Cloud**
>
[Sign up free](https://ui.hindsight.vectorize.io/signup) and grab an API key — no self-hosting required.
1. **Sign up** at [Hindsight Cloud](https://ui.hindsight.vectorize.io/signup) (free tier) or [self-host](../../developer/installation.md)
2. **Get an API key** (`hsk_...`) from the Hindsight dashboard

> **📝 Availability**
>
The native Hindsight Zapier app (the **Retain / Recall / Reflect** steps and triggers) is
currently a **private beta** — it isn't listed in Zapier's public App Directory yet, so
searching "Hindsight" in Zapier won't find it. Use the **Webhooks by Zapier** path below.
### Webhooks by Zapier

Every Hindsight operation is a plain REST call, so you can drive it from Zapier's built-in
**Webhooks by Zapier** action (or **API Request**) with nothing to install:

- **Method:** `POST`
- **URL** (Hindsight Cloud):
  - Retain — `https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io/v1/default/banks/<bank>/memories`
  - Recall — `https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io/v1/default/banks/<bank>/memories/recall`
  - Reflect — `https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io/v1/default/banks/<bank>/reflect`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer hsk_...` and `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body:** the JSON payload for the operation — see the [API Reference](../../openapi.json) for the exact fields.

For self-hosted, swap the host for your own instance URL; drop the `Authorization` header if it runs without auth.

## Actions

### Retain

Store content in a bank. Hindsight extracts facts asynchronously after the call returns.

| Field     | Description                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bank      | Memory bank to store in (dynamic dropdown; auto-created on first use) |
| Content   | Free text to retain                                                   |
| Context   | Optional context for the content                                      |
| Tags      | Comma-separated tags                                                  |
| Timestamp | When the content occurred (defaults to now)                           |

### Recall (search)

Search a bank for memories relevant to a query.

| Field             | Description            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Bank              | Memory bank to search  |
| Query             | Natural-language query |
| Budget            | `low` / `mid` / `high` |
| Tags / Tags Match | Optional tag filter    |

### Reflect (search)

Get an LLM-synthesized answer grounded in the bank's memories.

| Field  | Description            |
| ------ | ---------------------- |
| Bank   | Memory bank            |
| Query  | Question to answer     |
| Budget | `low` / `mid` / `high` |

## Triggers

Instant triggers (REST Hooks) that fire when a memory event completes in a bank:

| Trigger                      | Fires when                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Retain Completed**         | An asynchronous retain finishes processing                    |
| **Consolidation Completed**  | Memory consolidation synthesizes observations / mental models |

## Example Zaps

**Support assistant** — a closed-ticket trigger (Zendesk) → Hindsight **Retain** the resolution. New ticket → Hindsight **Recall** similar past issues → OpenAI drafts the first reply.

**Memory digest** — Hindsight **Consolidation Completed** trigger → format the new observations → post to Slack so the team sees what the agent learned.

**Daily prep** — a calendar trigger → Hindsight **Reflect** ("What do we know about this prospect?") → append the answer to the prep doc.
