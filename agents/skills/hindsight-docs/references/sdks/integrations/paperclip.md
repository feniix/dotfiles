# Paperclip

Persistent memory for [Paperclip AI](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) agents using [Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io).

Install the `@vectorize-io/hindsight-paperclip` plugin once. Every agent in your Paperclip instance automatically gets long-term memory that persists across runs, companies, and restarts — no code changes required.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm paperclipai plugin install @vectorize-io/hindsight-paperclip
```

Then configure in **Settings → Plugins → Hindsight Memory**.

## Prerequisites

> **💡 Hindsight Cloud (recommended)**
>
[Sign up free](https://ui.hindsight.vectorize.io/signup) — no infrastructure to run. Skip straight to Configuration below.
**Self-hosting alternative** — run Hindsight locally:

```bash
pip install hindsight-all
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY=your-openai-key
hindsight-api
```

## How It Works

```
agent.run.started
  └─ fetch issue via ctx.issues.get
       └─ recall(issueTitle + description) → cached in plugin state for this run

agent running…
  ├─ hindsight_recall(query) → returns cached context or live recall
  └─ hindsight_retain(content) → stores immediately

issue.comment.created
  └─ retain(full comment body via ctx.issues.listComments)
       └─ bank attribution: agent comment author when present; otherwise issue assignee

agent.run.finished
  └─ no-op (subscription kept for future use when payload carries output)
```

The bundled plugin manifest declares the `issues.read` and `issue.comments.read` capabilities needed by the new SDK calls, so Paperclip may prompt for these on first install or upgrade.

Memory is keyed to `companyId` + `agentId` — never to the run ID — so it accumulates across every run.

## Configuration

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `hindsightApiUrl` | `https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io` | Hindsight server URL (Cloud default; use `http://localhost:8888` for self-hosted) |
| `hindsightApiKeyRef` | — | Paperclip secret name holding Hindsight Cloud API key |
| `dynamicBankId` | `true` | When `true`, bank ID is derived from `bankGranularity`. Set `false` and provide `bankId` to share one static memory bank across agents |
| `bankId` | — | Static bank ID used when `dynamicBankId` is `false`. All agents sharing this value read/write the same memory bank |
| `bankGranularity` | `["company", "agent"]` | Memory isolation when `dynamicBankId` is `true`: per company+agent, per company, or per agent. Add `"user"` for per-user memory isolation (useful for GDPR compliance) |
| `recallBudget` | `mid` | `low` = fastest, `mid` = balanced, `high` = most thorough |
| `autoRetain` | `true` | Automatically retain run output after every run |

## Bank ID Format

```
paperclip::{companyId}::{agentId}                  ← default (company + agent granularity)
paperclip::{companyId}                             ← company granularity (shared across agents)
paperclip::{agentId}                               ← agent granularity (agent memory across companies)
paperclip::{companyId}::{agentId}::user::{userId}  ← user granularity (per-user isolation, GDPR-friendly)
{bankId}                                           ← static shared bank (dynamicBankId = false)
```

## Agent Tools

Agents can call these tools directly during a run:

**`hindsight_recall(query)`** — search memory for relevant context. Called automatically at run start; agents can also call it mid-run for targeted queries.

**`hindsight_retain(content)`** — store a fact or decision immediately, without waiting for run end.

## Adapter Compatibility

Works with all Paperclip adapter types via the event system:

| Adapter | Supported |
