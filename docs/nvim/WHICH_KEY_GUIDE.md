# Which-Key Guide

Which-key provides helpful popup menus showing available keybindings when you start typing a key sequence. Perfect for discovering and remembering your extensive keymap configuration!

**Note**: This configuration uses the modern which-key.nvim v3 API with the `add()` method for improved performance and maintainability.

## Installation

1. Run `:PackerSync` in Neovim to install which-key
2. Restart Neovim
3. Start typing any leader key sequence and see the magic! ‚ú®
4. Run `:checkhealth which-key` to verify everything is working properly

## Tips

1. **Wait for the popup** - Don't rush! Let which-key show you options
2. **Learn gradually** - Focus on one group at a time
3. **Use frequently** - The more you use it, the faster you'll remember
4. **Scroll through options** - Use `<C-d>`/`<C-u>` to scroll long lists
5. **ESC to cancel** - Press Escape if you start a sequence by mistake

## Customization

All groups and descriptions are defined in `nvim/lua/user/which-key.lua`. You can:
- Add new key groups
- Modify descriptions
- Change the popup appearance
- Add buffer-specific mappings

### Plugin Overlaps

Some plugins use intentional "overlapping" keymaps that are actually hierarchical. These appear as warnings in `:checkhealth which-key` but are **expected behavior**:

**vim-surround / nvim-surround:**
- `ys` + motion - Add surround around motion (waits for motion)
- `yss` - Add surround around current line (complete command)
- `yS` + motion - Add surround around motion with new lines (waits for motion)
- `ySS` - Add surround around current line with new lines (complete command)

**Comment.nvim:**
- `gc` + motion - Comment linewise over motion (waits for motion)
- `gcc` - Comment current line (complete command)
- `gcA` - Comment at end of line (complete command)
- `gco` / `gcO` - Comment line below/above (complete commands)
- `gb` + motion - Comment blockwise over motion (waits for motion)
- `gbc` - Comment current block (complete command)

**Why these aren't real conflicts:**
- The shorter keys (`ys`, `gc`, `gb`) wait for additional input (motion or text object)
- The longer keys (`yss`, `gcc`, `gbc`) are complete commands that execute immediately
- This is how these plugins are designed to work - it's **intentional hierarchical design**

**Configuration:** Overlap notifications are disabled in the which-key setup because these warnings are false positives for legitimate plugin behavior.

These are documented in the which-key configuration so you can see helpful descriptions when you press these keys.
