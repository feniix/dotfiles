## Tips & Tricks

### **1. Efficient File Navigation**
- Use `<Tab>`/`<S-Tab>` to quickly cycle through changed files
- Use `i` to toggle between list and tree view for better organization
- Use `f` to flatten nested directories

### **2. Staging Workflow**
- Use `-` to quickly stage/unstage individual files
- Use `S`/`U` to stage/unstage all files at once
- Combine with `<leader>gS` to review staged changes

### **3. Merge Conflict Resolution**
- Use `]x`/`[x` to jump between conflicts
- Use conflict choice commands (`<leader>co`, `<leader>ct`, etc.)
- Use `dx` to delete entire conflict sections

### **4. History Exploration**
- Use visual selection + `<leader>gh` to see history for specific lines
- Use `y` in history view to copy commit hashes for other Git commands
- Use `L` to see full commit details

### **5. Integration with Other Tools**
- Copy commit hashes with `y` and use in terminal: `git show <hash>`
- Use `gf` to open files for editing while keeping diff view open
- Use `<C-w>gf` to open in new tab for side-by-side editing

## Customization

The diffview configuration is in `nvim/lua/user/diffview.lua`. You can:
- Change panel positions and sizes
- Modify keybindings
- Add custom Git commands
- Change file listing style defaults

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Diffview won't open**
A: Make sure you're in a Git repository and have changes to view.

**Q: Can't see staged changes**  
A: Use `<leader>gS` or `:DiffviewOpen --staged` specifically for staged changes.

**Q: Performance issues with large repos**
A: Consider using specific file paths: `:DiffviewOpen -- path/to/files`

**Q: Merge conflicts look confusing**
A: Use `g?` for help, and remember `]x`/`[x` to navigate between conflicts.

## Integration with Gitsigns

diffview.nvim works perfectly with gitsigns.nvim:
- Use gitsigns for inline change indicators
- Use diffview for comprehensive diff viewing
- Both share the `<leader>g` keymap group for consistency

Enjoy exploring your Git history and changes! ðŸŽ‰
