# Brainstorm Sections

This reference describes what makes a great brainstorm requirements document.
It does NOT prescribe how the doc looks on the page — rendering is handled by
the format-specific references (`markdown-rendering.md`, `html-rendering.md`).

## The outcome

A great brainstorm produces a doc that enables three audiences to act:

- **The planning agent** (`ce-plan` or a human) produces an implementation
  plan without inventing user behavior, scope boundaries, or success
  criteria — the brainstorm answered those.
- **The reviewer** sees the framing choices, distinguishes pinned from open,
  and catches scope gaps before planning.
- **The future reader** traces why the proposed thing matters, who it's for,
  and what success looks like.

Sections earn their place by serving one of these audiences. Omit padding.

## Decide whether a doc is warranted at all

Brainstorm dialogue does not always need to produce a durable document.
Skip document creation when **both** hold:

- The user only needs brief alignment — no exploration produced novel scope,
  framing, or decisions worth preserving in IDed shape.
- Any durable decisions made during the dialogue can flow naturally to
  downstream artifacts (`ce-plan`, the commit message, `docs/solutions/`)
  without a brainstorm doc as an intermediary.

The trigger for creating a doc is when the dialogue surfaced enough
structural decisions, scope boundaries, or acceptance criteria that
downstream consumers (planner, reviewer, future reader) need them in a
durable, IDed form — not just as conversational artifacts.

**Stress test:** a brainstorm about a tiny bug fix where the user asks "fix
this with a null check or with upstream validation?" and the agent confirms
"upstream validation, here's why" doesn't need a brainstorm doc. The
decision flows to `ce-plan` (or directly to commit message, or to
`docs/solutions/` if it's a pattern worth carrying) without a brainstorm
artifact in the middle.

Conversely, a brainstorm about a multi-actor feature with contested scope
and several behavioral conditions probably does need a doc — the planning
agent needs the structured content the dialogue produced.

## Match depth to content

When a doc IS warranted, depth matches what the dialogue produced. A
brainstorm with sparse content produces a sparse doc; one with rich content
produces a rich doc. Don't add ceremony to make a slim brainstorm look
substantial.

## Prose economy

Match-depth-to-content sizes *which* sections appear and how deep each goes.
This sizes *how the kept prose reads*. A section can be material and still be
written loosely — the failure mode is a material section padded into a wall of
text where contradictions hide and a downstream agent loses the thread. Length
that earns its place is fine; wordiness around that length is not.

Hold every kept section to these:

- **One idea per sentence.** A Summary is a handful of sentences, not one
  sentence with five semicolons and four parentheticals. If a sentence needs a
  second parenthetical to stay true, split it.
- **A requirement is one sentence of intent plus at most one qualifier.** When
  a requirement would specify two outcomes ("either A or B, planning decides"),
  state the intent and send the fork to Outstanding Questions — don't write both
  arms in full inside the requirement.
- **Cut hedges and intensifiers.** "Critically", "deliberately", "explicitly",
  "genuinely", "actually", "simply" carry nothing a downstream agent acts on.
- **Prefer the verb to the nominalization.** "Demote the grid", not "the
  demotion of the grid is the deliberate change in this brief".

Precision is not padding: keep domain terms, conditionals, and exact thresholds
verbatim. Economy targets the connective tissue around them, never the precision
itself.

**Resolve in place; don't stratify.** When a later decision answers a parked
question or supersedes earlier text, rewrite or remove the original entry —
don't append a separate "resolutions" layer that leaves the superseded text
standing, and don't keep superseded prose as strikethrough. Version control
holds the history. Stacked question/resolution strata double the reading surface
and hide which text is live.

**Named test, run before the doc is declared written:** could a reader find a
contradiction in each section in one pass? A sentence carrying more than one
parenthetical, or a requirement specifying two outcomes, fails the test — split
it or defer it.

## Hard floor

When a doc is warranted, these are present.

- **Summary** — what is being proposed, in 1-3 lines. Forward-looking.
  Orients the reader before they invest in detail.
- **Requirements** (with stable R-IDs) — what must be true about the
  proposed thing. For very sparse brainstorms (≤3 simple items where the
  bullets ARE the summary), plain bullets without IDs are acceptable; the
  trigger for R-IDs is whether downstream consumers will reference them.
  When requirements span distinct concerns (e.g., "Packaging" /
  "Migration and compatibility" / "Contributor workflow"), group them
  under bold inline headers within the Requirements section — group by
  capability or concern, not by the order requirements were discussed.
  The trigger is distinct concerns, not item count — even four
  requirements benefit if they cover three different topics. Skip
  grouping only when all requirements are genuinely about the same thing;
  a long flat list is a smell that subgroups were missed. R-IDs stay
  continuous across groups (R1, R2 in the first group; R3, R4 in the
  second; never restart at R1 per group).

## Include when material

The agent decides per brainstorm whether each section carries information
that isn't covered elsewhere. Filling a section with placeholder prose is
worse than omitting it.

- **Problem Frame** — include when motivation isn't obvious from Summary
  alone (the *why* needs paragraphs, not a sentence). Backward-looking /
  situational. Does NOT restate the proposal; the remedy lives in Summary.

- **Key Decisions** — include when the brainstorm produced opinionated
  framing choices (defaults, scope narrowings, foundational technical picks)
  that constrain Requirements / Flows / Scope below. Each entry names the
  decision in bold with prose rationale. Sits high in the rendered doc so
  readers encounter the framing choices before descending into detail.

- **Actors** — include when the proposed thing has multi-party behavior
  (multiple humans, agents, or systems meaningfully involved). Skip for
  non-behavioral brainstorms (naming briefs, data-shape briefs, pure
  research, decision frameworks).

- **Key Flows** — include when the proposed thing has multi-step behavior.
  Expected by default for behavioral brainstorms unless the proposed thing
  is genuinely non-flow-shaped (pure API surface, policy, artifact output)
  and Actors / Requirements / Scope Boundaries / Acceptance Examples
  together prevent downstream invention of paths. When omitting from a
  behavioral brainstorm, note the reason in the doc.

- **Visualizations** — include a diagram when the brainstorm contains a
  diagram-shaped concept that a picture carries faster than prose. Common
  shapes: a data-shape transformation (before/after schema or field
  mapping), a source-of-truth fan-out (one authority feeding many derived
  surfaces), state-or-lifecycle logic, a multi-step flow, or a quantitative
  comparison. A diagram is cross-cutting, not a section of its own — it sits
  next to the Key Decision, Requirements group, or Flow it illustrates. The
  named test: *does the picture let a reader grasp the concept faster than
  the paragraph alone?* If yes, add it; if the prose already conveys it at a
  glance, skip it. One diagram per load-bearing concept — don't add visuals
  for ceremony. This affordance is the conceptual-diagram path; it is
  distinct from the wireframe affordance (a wireframe is for visual-product
  UI and does not apply to non-visual systems like data models or agent
  workflows, but a conceptual diagram does).

  **Diagrams complement prose; they never replace it.** A diagram is an
  on-ramp to the prose it illustrates, not a substitute. The IDed prose
  (Requirements, Key Decisions, Acceptance Examples) stays complete and
  standalone — a reader who ignores every diagram still gets the full
  content in text, and a downstream agent that reads the artifact as linear
  text is never left with a relationship that exists only in an SVG. Adding
  a before/after diagram is not license to thin the requirement or decision
  prose it depicts.

- **Acceptance Examples** — include when any requirement has a
  state-dependent or conditional shape ("When X, Y") where prose alone leaves
  ambiguity about edge cases. **Always include AEs covering
  behavioral-conditional requirements** — that's where the ambiguity bites
  hardest. Skip when all requirements are unconditional and unambiguous.

- **Success Criteria** — include when there are quality / metric / handoff
  signals that Requirements don't already carry: quantitative metrics ("p95
  latency under 200ms"), qualitative criteria ("the agent's output reads as
  one voice"), process / handoff quality ("ce-doc-review can act on this
  without follow-ups"). Skip when Requirements ARE the success criteria
  (every R is "done when the R is true").

- **Scope Boundaries** — include when scope is contested or there are
  tempting non-goals worth naming explicitly. When the brainstorm is about
  positioning a product against adjacent ones the team could have built but
  is rejecting, split into "Deferred for later" (eventually but not v1) and
  "Outside this product's identity" (positioning decision). Otherwise, a
  single list is fine.

- **Dependencies / Assumptions** — include when material upstream
  dependencies exist or when load-bearing assumptions need to be surfaced.

- **Outstanding Questions** — include when there are unresolved items.
  Distinguish "Resolve Before Planning" (blocks planning) from "Deferred to
  Planning" (answered during planning or codebase exploration).

- **Sources / Research** — surface research that orients the planner or
  justifies framing choices. The test: *"if I were the planner reading this
  cold, would this breadcrumb help me make better choices?"* Yes → surface
  (code locations, external docs, RFCs, constraints, prior plans — the
  category is inclusive, not enumerated). Process exhaust (reading the
  user's prompt, glancing at obvious files) → omit.

## Agent agency

The catalog is a floor, not a ceiling. When the brainstorm's content doesn't
fit any catalog section, introduce a new one — don't force the content into
a section it doesn't belong in. Content drives section choices, not vice
versa.

The agent also picks per artifact:

- Whether Acceptance Examples render as a separate section or embed in each
  requirement
- How much depth each present section gets

(Requirements grouping is covered above in the Hard Floor item — group by
concern by default, rendering a flat list only when all requirements are
about the same thing, with continuous R-IDs across groups.)

## Brainstorm metadata fields

Every brainstorm carries a small set of stable metadata fields that
downstream tooling depends on. The contract is format-independent: in
markdown these fields appear as YAML frontmatter at the top of the file; in
HTML they appear as visible header text (typically a `<dl>` of `<dt>`/`<dd>`
pairs or a stats strip). Field names and semantics are the same across both
formats so consumers can locate them without knowing which format produced
the brainstorm.

### Required

- **`date`** — creation date in ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`), ASCII digits only.
  Used in the filename (`docs/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-requirements.<md|html>`).
- **`topic`** — kebab-case slug identifying the brainstorm subject (e.g.,
  `surface-scope-earlier`, `demo-reel-local-save`). Used in the filename
  alongside `date` and as the resume-detection key when `ce-brainstorm`'s
  Phase 0.1 scans `docs/brainstorms/` for an existing artifact to continue.

### Status flip does not apply to brainstorm

Unlike plans, brainstorm artifacts have no `status` field — there is no
`active → completed` lifecycle. A brainstorm is a one-time output that
downstream consumers (`ce-plan`, `ce-doc-review`) reference via the plan's
`origin:` field. The `<span class="status">` HTML hook described in
`html-rendering.md` is a plan-side mechanic and does not render on
brainstorm artifacts.

### Field-name stability

Field names are stable across brainstorm revisions — never rename a field
or repurpose its semantics. Agents composing new brainstorms MUST use these
exact names; adding new fields is fine, but renaming `topic` to `subject`
or `date` to `created` breaks filename construction and resume detection.

## ID and content rules

Same shape as plan rules.

- **Stable IDs.** R-IDs (Requirements), A-IDs (if Actors fire), F-IDs (if
  Flows fire), AE-IDs (if Acceptance Examples fire). No other ID namespaces.
- **Plain prefix.** `R1.`, `A1.`, `F1.`, `AE1.` as bullet prefixes. Do not
  bold; the prefix is visually distinctive on its own.
- **Bold leader labels** inside Flows and Acceptance Examples
  (`**Trigger:**`, `**Covers R4, R8.**`) provide structure without deeper
  heading levels.
- **Repo-relative paths.** Always. Never absolute paths.
- **No process exhaust.** No "captured at Phase X" notes, no `## Next Steps`
  pointing to ce-plan, no italic provenance lines. Engineering process
  metadata belongs in commit messages and tool output, not the artifact.
- **No implementation details by default.** Libraries, schemas, endpoints,
  file layouts, code structure stay out unless the brainstorm itself is
  inherently about a technical or architectural change and those details are
  the subject of the decision.

## Discipline: Summary vs Problem Frame

When both sections are present, they earn separate sections only by holding
to different purposes:

| Section | Question it answers | Time direction | Length |
|---|---|---|---|
| `## Summary` | What is this doc proposing? | Forward-looking | 1-3 lines |
| `## Problem Frame` | Why does this proposal exist? | Backward-looking / situational | Paragraphs |

- **Summary doesn't need problem context.** A reader scanning Summary gets
  the proposal at a glance.
- **Problem Frame doesn't restate the proposal.** It establishes the
  situation, the specific moment of pain, and the cost shape — then stops.
  The remedy lives in Summary; restating it in Problem Frame is the
  duplication that makes the two sections feel redundant.

## Rendering

The format-specific references describe how to render these sections in each
output format:

- **Markdown rendering:** `references/markdown-rendering.md`
- **HTML rendering:** `references/html-rendering.md`

This reference (`brainstorm-sections.md`) is about WHAT the brainstorm
contains; rendering references are about HOW each format presents it. The
brainstorm is written in one format — markdown OR HTML, never both — based
on the resolved output mode. The section catalog is the same regardless of
format.
