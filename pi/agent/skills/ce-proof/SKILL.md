description: Run human-in-the-loop review loops over markdown via Proof (proofeditor.ai) — share, view, comment on, edit, and sync collaborative docs. Use when the user says "view this in proof", "share to proof", "HITL this doc", or wants a shared markdown review surface for a spec, plan, or draft, including handoffs from ce-brainstorm, ce-ideate, or ce-plan. Do not trigger on "proof" meaning evidence, math proofs, proof-of-concept, or "proofread this".

# Proof - Collaborative Markdown Editor

Proof is a collaborative document editor for humans and agents. It supports two modes:

1. **Web API** - Create and edit shared documents via HTTP (no install needed)
2. **Local Bridge** - Drive the macOS Proof app via localhost:9847

## Identity and Attribution

Every write to a Proof doc must be attributed. Two fields carry the agent's identity:

- **Machine ID (`by` on every op, `X-Agent-Id` header):** `ai:compound-engineering` — stable, lowercase-hyphenated, machine-parseable. Appears in marks, events, and the API response.
- **Display name (`name` on `POST /presence`):** `Compound Engineering` — human-readable, shown in Proof's presence chips and comment-author badges.

Set the display name once per doc session by posting to presence with the `X-Agent-Id` header; Proof binds the name to that agent ID for the session. These values are the defaults for any caller of this skill; callers running HITL review (`references/hitl-review.md`) may pass a different `identity` pair if a distinct sub-agent should own the doc. Do not use `ai:compound` or other ad-hoc variants — identity stays uniform unless a caller explicitly overrides it.

## Human-in-the-Loop Review Mode

Human-in-the-loop iteration over an existing local markdown file: upload to Proof, let the user annotate in Proof's web UI, ingest feedback as in-thread replies and agreed edits, and sync the final doc back to disk. Two entry points, identical mechanics — load `references/hitl-review.md` for the full loop spec (invocation contract, mark classification, idempotent ingest passes, exception-based terminal reporting, end-sync atomic write) in either case:

- **Direct user request** — a bare user phrase naming a local markdown file and asking to iterate collaboratively via Proof: "share this to proof so we can iterate", "iterate with proof on this doc", "HITL this file with me", "let's get feedback on this in proof", "open this in proof editor so I can review". The file is whichever markdown the user just created, edited, or referenced; if ambiguous, ask which file. This is a first-class entry point — do not require an upstream caller.
- **Upstream skill handoff** — `ce-brainstorm`, `ce-ideate`, or `ce-plan` finishes a draft and hands it off for human review before the next phase, passing the file path and title explicitly.

## Web API (Primary for Sharing)

### Create a Shared Document

No authentication required. Returns a shareable URL with access token.

```bash
curl -X POST https://www.proofeditor.ai/share/markdown \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"My Doc","markdown":"# Hello\n\nContent here."}'
```

**Response format:**
```json
{
  "slug": "abc123",
  "tokenUrl": "https://www.proofeditor.ai/d/abc123?token=xxx",
  "accessToken": "xxx",
  "ownerSecret": "yyy",
  "_links": {
    "state": "https://www.proofeditor.ai/api/agent/abc123/state",
    "ops": "https://www.proofeditor.ai/api/agent/abc123/ops"
  }
}
```

Use the `tokenUrl` as the shareable link. The `_links` give you the exact API paths.

### Read a Shared Document

If you already have a shared Proof URL, no browser automation is needed. Fetch the URL directly with content negotiation:

```bash
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" "https://www.proofeditor.ai/d/{slug}?token=<token>"
curl -s -H "Accept: text/markdown" "https://www.proofeditor.ai/d/{slug}?token=<token>"
```

The JSON response includes the markdown, API links, and agent auth hints. Use `/state` when you need mutation metadata, marks, or presence:

```bash
curl -s "https://www.proofeditor.ai/api/agent/{slug}/state" \
  -H "x-share-token: <token>"
```

For comment-ingest workflows, prefer the server-side filter:

```bash
curl -s "https://www.proofeditor.ai/api/agent/{slug}/state?kinds=comment" \
  -H "x-share-token: <token>"
```

`state.marks` is a union of comments, suggestions, and provenance/authorship marks. The `?kinds=comment` filter avoids treating human-authored provenance marks as review comments.

### Edit a Shared Document

Comment, suggestion, and rewrite operations go to `POST https://www.proofeditor.ai/api/agent/{slug}/ops`. Block edits use `/api/agent/{slug}/edit/v2`.

**Note:** Use the `/api/agent/{slug}/ops` path (from `_links` in create response), NOT `/api/documents/{slug}/ops`.

**Authentication for protected docs:**
- Header: `x-share-token: <token>` or `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Token comes from the URL parameter: `?token=xxx` or the `accessToken` from create response
- Header: `X-Agent-Id: ai:compound-engineering` (required for presence; include on ops for consistent attribution)

**Wire-format reminder.** `/api/agent/{slug}/ops` uses a top-level `type` field; `/api/agent/{slug}/edit/v2` uses an `operations` array where each entry has `op`. Do not mix — sending `op` to `/ops` returns 422.

**Every mutation requires a `baseToken`.** Reuse the `mutationBase.token` from the most recent `/state` or `/snapshot` read, then update it from successful mutation responses (`.mutationBase.token`). On `BASE_TOKEN_REQUIRED` or `STALE_BASE`, re-read and retry once. Only do a pre-mutation read if no prior read has happened in this session or you need fresh document/comment/snapshot content. See the baseToken recipe in `references/hitl-review.md`.

`/edit/v2` block refs are a separate concern: they can drift across revisions, so re-fetch `/snapshot` for fresh refs before a block edit if any writes have landed since your last snapshot.

### Edit Strategy: Avoid Whole-Doc Rewrite

Do not default to full-document replacement. Pick the narrowest edit primitive that matches the requested change:

1. **Literal repeated change:** use `/edit/v2` with `find_replace_in_doc` (optionally constrained by `fromRef`, `toRef`, or `block_filter`). This is the fastest and least error-prone path for terminology renames, punctuation/style sweeps, and other exact text substitutions.
2. **Known block or section change:** use `/edit/v2` block operations from a fresh `/snapshot`: `replace_block`, `insert_before`, `insert_after`, `delete_block`, `replace_range`, or `find_replace_in_block`.
3. **Visible track-changes desired:** use `/ops` `suggestion.add` (pending or `status: "accepted"`) when the user should see a suggestion mark and reject/revert affordance for that specific edit.
4. **Whole-doc replacement:** use `rewrite.apply` only as a last resort when the user explicitly asks to replace the entire document, when the intended change is genuinely global and cannot be expressed as block/range/find-replace operations, and when no live clients are present. Before rewriting, read current state, preserve comments/marks expectations, and mention that the rewrite is broad.

When in doubt, start with `/snapshot` and build a small `/edit/v2` batch. A narrow failed edit is easier to inspect and retry than a broad rewrite, and it avoids clobbering concurrent human work.

**Retry discipline after mutation errors — verify before retrying.** An error response is not proof that nothing was written.

- `STALE_BASE`, `BASE_TOKEN_REQUIRED`, `MISSING_BASE`, `INVALID_BASE_TOKEN` — pre-commit, token-related. Re-read `/state`, rebuild the request body with a fresh `baseToken`, and retry once with a new `Idempotency-Key`.
- `ANCHOR_NOT_FOUND`, `ANCHOR_AMBIGUOUS` — pre-commit, but the `quote` no longer uniquely matches content. Re-reading does not help by itself; the caller must tighten or regenerate the anchor before retrying. Do not auto-retry blindly.
- `INVALID_OPERATIONS`, `INVALID_REQUEST`, `INVALID_REF`, `INVALID_BLOCK_MARKDOWN`, `INVALID_RANGE`, `INVALID_MARKDOWN`, 422 — pre-commit, but the payload is wrong. Do not retry blindly; fix the payload first.
- `COLLAB_SYNC_FAILED`, `REWRITE_BARRIER_FAILED`, `PROJECTION_STALE`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`, 5xx, network timeout, and any **202 with `collab.status: "pending"`** — the canonical doc may have been written even though the call looks like a failure. Before any retry, re-read `/state` and check whether the intended mark/edit is already present; only retry if it isn't.
- `Idempotency-Key` (see below) protects against double-apply *on the same request* (e.g., TCP-level retry). It does not help if you build a new request body and send a second call — that is a new logical write with a new key.

Duplicate-mark incidents usually come from retrying a `comment.add` or `suggestion.add` after a timeout without verifying. When in doubt: re-read, diff, then decide.

**`Idempotency-Key` header** is recommended on every mutation for safe automation retries; required when `/state.contract.idempotencyRequired` is true. Use the same key only when resending the exact same serialized request body. If the body changes — including because you replaced `baseToken` after `STALE_BASE` — mint a new key or Proof will reject it as key reuse with a different payload.

**Comment on text:**
```json
{"type": "comment.add", "quote": "text to comment on", "by": "ai:compound-engineering", "text": "Your comment here", "baseToken": "<token>"}
```

**Reply to a comment:**
```json
{"type": "comment.reply", "markId": "<id>", "by": "ai:compound-engineering", "text": "Reply text", "baseToken": "<token>"}
```

**Reply and resolve in one mutation:**
```json
{"type": "comment.reply", "markId": "<id>", "by": "ai:compound-engineering", "text": "Fixed.", "resolve": true, "baseToken": "<token>"}
```

**Batch existing-thread comment mutations:**
```json
{"by": "ai:compound-engineering", "baseToken": "<token>", "operations": [
  {"type": "comment.reply", "markId": "<id-1>", "text": "Fixed.", "resolve": true},
  {"type": "comment.reply", "markId": "<id-2>", "text": "Leaving this open because X."}
]}
```

Batch `/ops` supports `comment.reply`, `comment.resolve`, and `comment.unresolve` for existing threads. Use it for HITL ingest passes instead of issuing separate reply and resolve requests per thread.

**Resolve / unresolve a comment:**
```json
{"type": "comment.resolve", "markId": "<id>", "by": "ai:compound-engineering", "baseToken": "<token>"}
{"type": "comment.unresolve", "markId": "<id>", "by": "ai:compound-engineering", "baseToken": "<token>"}
```

**Suggest a replacement (pending — user must accept/reject):**
```json
{"type": "suggestion.add", "kind": "replace", "quote": "original text", "by": "ai:compound-engineering", "content": "replacement text", "baseToken": "<token>"}
```

**Suggest and immediately apply (tracked but committed — user can reject to revert):**
```json
{"type": "suggestion.add", "kind": "replace", "quote": "original text", "by": "ai:compound-engineering", "content": "replacement text", "status": "accepted", "baseToken": "<token>"}
```

`status: "accepted"` creates the suggestion mark and commits the change in one call. The mark persists as an audit trail with per-edit attribution and a reject-to-revert affordance. Works with `kind: "insert" | "delete" | "replace"`.

**Accept or reject an existing suggestion:**
```json
{"type": "suggestion.accept", "markId": "<id>", "by": "ai:compound-engineering", "baseToken": "<token>"}
{"type": "suggestion.reject", "markId": "<id>", "by": "ai:compound-engineering", "baseToken": "<token>"}
```

`suggestion.resolve` is not supported — use accept or reject instead.

**Whole-doc rewrite (last resort):**
```json
{"type": "rewrite.apply", "content": "full new markdown", "by": "ai:compound-engineering", "baseToken": "<token>"}
```

Prefer `find_replace_in_doc` or block-level `/edit/v2` operations first. `rewrite.apply` is broad, disruptive, and blocked while live clients are connected.

**Block-level edits via `/edit/v2`** (separate endpoint, separate shape):
```bash
curl -X POST "https://www.proofeditor.ai/api/agent/{slug}/edit/v2" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-share-token: <token>" \
  -H "X-Agent-Id: ai:compound-engineering" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: <uuid>" \
  -d '{
    "by": "ai:compound-engineering",
    "baseToken": "mt1:<token>",
    "operations": [
      {"op": "replace_block", "ref": "b3", "block": {"markdown": "Updated paragraph."}},
      {"op": "insert_after", "ref": "b3", "blocks": [{"markdown": "## New section"}]}
    ]
  }'
```

Per-op body shape (singular `block` vs plural `blocks` is load-bearing — sending the wrong one returns 422):

| op | body fields |
|---|---|
| `replace_block` | `ref`, `block: {markdown}` |
| `insert_after` | `ref`, `blocks: [{markdown}, ...]` |
| `insert_before` | `ref`, `blocks: [{markdown}, ...]` |
| `delete_block` | `ref` |
| `replace_range` | `fromRef`, `toRef`, `blocks: [{markdown}, ...]` |
| `find_replace_in_block` | `ref`, `find`, `replace`, `occurrence: "first" \| "all"` |
| `find_replace_in_doc` | `find`, `replace`, `occurrence: "first" \| "all"`, optional `fromRef`, `toRef`, `block_filter` |

Read `/snapshot` to get block `ref` IDs and `mutationBase.token`. `ref` values are opaque request tokens tied to the snapshot/baseToken; re-read `/snapshot` before follow-up block edits if writes have landed. `operations` commits atomically — either every op lands or none do — so one `/edit/v2` call can batch dozens of block edits safely and efficiently (see the bulk-sweep guidance in `references/hitl-review.md` Phase 2.4). Successful full responses include the next `mutationBase.token` and fresh `snapshot.blocks[].ref` values for chaining.

For literal doc-wide sweeps, prefer `find_replace_in_doc` over many block replacements or a whole-doc rewrite. Validate large batches with `?dryRun=1` or `?validate=1`; use `?return=minimal` when you only need `ok`, `revision`, `appliedCount`, and the next `mutationBase`.

**Editing while a client is connected is fine.** `/edit/v2`, `suggestion.add` (including `status: "accepted"`), and all comment ops work during active collab. Only `rewrite.apply` is blocked by `LIVE_CLIENTS_PRESENT` — it would clobber in-flight Yjs edits.

**When the loop breaks.** If a mutation keeps failing after a fresh read and one retry, or state across reads looks inconsistent, call `POST https://www.proofeditor.ai/api/bridge/report_bug` with the failing request ID, slug, and raw response. The server enriches and files an issue.

### Known Limitations (Web API)

- Bridge-style endpoints (`/d/{slug}/bridge/*`) require client version headers (`x-proof-client-version`, `x-proof-client-build`, `x-proof-client-protocol`) and return 426 CLIENT_UPGRADE_REQUIRED without them. Use `/api/agent/{slug}/ops` instead.

## Local Bridge (macOS App)

Requires Proof.app running. Bridge at `http://localhost-9847`.

**Required headers:**
- `X-Agent-Id: ai:compound-engineering` (identity for presence; keep aligned with `by`)
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `X-Window-Id: <uuid>` (when multiple docs open)

## Workflow: Review a Shared Document

When given a Proof URL like `https://www.proofeditor.ai/d/abc123?token=xxx`:

1. Extract the slug (`abc123`) and token from the URL
2. Read the document via content negotiation on the shared URL or via `/api/agent/{slug}/state` when you need marks/mutation metadata
3. For content edits, prefer `/edit/v2` `find_replace_in_doc` or block operations; use `/ops` for comments, suggestions, and comment replies/resolution
4. The author sees changes in real-time

```bash
SHARE_URL="https://www.proofeditor.ai/d/abc123?token=xxx"
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" "$SHARE_URL"
curl -s -H "Accept: text/markdown" "$SHARE_URL"

[ -n "$NEXT_BASE" ] && BASE="$NEXT_BASE"

# Direct content edit (preferred when visible suggestion marks are not needed)
SNAPSHOT=$(curl -s "https://www.proofeditor.ai/api/agent/abc123/snapshot" \
  -H "x-share-token: xxx")
EDIT_BASE=$(printf '%s' "$SNAPSHOT" | jq -r '.mutationBase.token')

## Workflow: Pull a Proof Doc to Local

Sync the current Proof doc state to a local markdown file. Used by:

- HITL review end-sync (`references/hitl-review.md` Phase 5) when the doc originated from a local file
- Ad-hoc snapshots of a Proof doc to disk (before closing the tab, archiving, handing off)
- Refreshing a local working copy against the live Proof version

```bash
SLUG=<slug>
TOKEN=<accessToken>
LOCAL=<absolute-path>

# One read to a temp file — avoids passing markdown through $(...), which would strip trailing newlines.
STATE_TMP=$(mktemp)
curl -s "https://www.proofeditor.ai/api/agent/$SLUG/state" \
  -H "x-share-token: $TOKEN" > "$STATE_TMP"
REVISION=$(jq -r '.revision' "$STATE_TMP")

# Atomic write: stream .markdown bytes directly to a temp sibling, then rename.
TMP="${LOCAL}.proof-sync.$$"
jq -jr '.markdown' "$STATE_TMP" > "$TMP" && mv "$TMP" "$LOCAL"
rm "$STATE_TMP"
```

`jq -jr` (`-j` no trailing newline, `-r` raw string) streams the markdown bytes straight to the temp file without going through a shell variable, so trailing newlines survive intact. `mv` within the same filesystem is atomic — a crashed write leaves the original untouched rather than a half-written file.

**Confirm before writing when the pull isn't directly asked for.** If a workflow ends up pulling as a side-effect of a different action (e.g., HITL review completion), surface the impending write with a short confirm like "Sync reviewed doc to `<localPath>`?" A silent overwrite is surprising — the user may have forgotten the local file exists in that session, or expected Proof to stay canonical until they explicitly asked to pull.

## Safety

- Use `/state` content as source of truth before editing
- During active collab use `edit/v2` (direct block changes) or `suggestion.add` (tracked changes); reserve `rewrite.apply` for no-client scenarios since it's blocked by `LIVE_CLIENTS_PRESENT` when anyone is connected
- Prefer `find_replace_in_doc` and block-level `/edit/v2` edits before considering `rewrite.apply`
- Don't span table cells in a single replace
- Always include `by: "ai:compound-engineering"` on every op and `X-Agent-Id: ai:compound-engineering` in headers for consistent attribution
- Reuse `baseToken` from your most recent `/state` or `/snapshot` read; on `STALE_BASE`, re-read and retry once
