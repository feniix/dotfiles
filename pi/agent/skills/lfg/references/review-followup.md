# Review followup (LFG step 3–4)

`ce-code-review` is review-only. LFG applies eligible fixes itself, then commits.

## Step 3 — invoke review

```
ce-code-review mode:agent plan:<plan-path-from-step-1>
```

Read the **Actionable Findings** summary and artifact path. Do not pass `mode:autofix`.

Capture parsed JSON (`status`, `actionable_findings`, `findings`, `artifact_path`, `run_id`) or the markdown Actionable Findings section. If `status` is `failed`, stop and surface `reason`.

## Step 4 — apply and persist review fixes

### What to apply

Apply a finding in the working tree only when **all** of the following hold:

1. **`suggested_fix` is present** — concrete change shape from the reviewer.
2. **`confidence` is `100`, or `75` with cross-persona agreement noted in the report** — do not apply anchor-50 findings.
3. **The fix is mechanical** — one coherent change, no contract/permission/security posture change, no new public API shape, no behavior change that needs product sign-off.
4. **Evidence still matches the code** at the cited `file:line` before editing.

Do not treat `autofix_class` as permission to auto-apply.

### What not to apply

- `autofix_class: manual` without a clear mechanical `suggested_fix`
- `autofix_class: advisory` — report-only
- `gated_auto` findings that change behavior, contracts, auth, or permissions
- Anything that needs a design conversation

### Execution

1. Filter `actionable_findings` (or markdown Actionable Findings) with the bar above.
2. Apply eligible fixes in the working tree in severity order (`#` stable from the review).
3. Run targeted tests when `requires_verification: true` on any applied finding.
4. If `git status --short` shows changes, stage only review-driven files, commit `fix(review): apply review findings`, and push before step 5. To push: if an upstream exists, run `git push`. If no upstream exists (common on a fresh feature branch, since step 7's `ce-commit-push-pr` has not run yet), resolve a writable remote dynamically: prefer `origin` when present, otherwise use `git remote` and choose the first configured remote. Then run `git push --set-upstream <remote> HEAD`. If no eligible fixes were applied, note explicitly and skip commit.

## Step 5 — residual handoff

Residuals are actionable findings **not** applied in step 4 — not leftovers from in-skill autofix. Use the Actionable Findings summary / artifact from step 3.
